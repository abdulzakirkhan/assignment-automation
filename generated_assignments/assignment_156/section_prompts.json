Or should organisations who make the wealth and set the standards we work to and live by be the ones that dictate this fairness?\nThere are some obvious talking points here, not just in the UK but across the world as authoritarian leaders focus on national interests to change behaviours.  However culture also plays a part as it needs to consider the interactions between different groups across society.  The following examples discuss how culture impacts different groups in everyday existence.\n\nFor example, in 2019 Parkfield primary school, a largely Muslim school suspended lessons about LGBT rights and homophobia following protests from parents.  The lessons had been designed to help children accept differences in society and teach them about religion, gender identify, age and disabilities.  However following criticism from some of the schools’ Muslim parents relating to same sex-couples education in the lessons the school suspended these lessons.  Parents insisted that the classes were not appropriate for their children by keeping them at home from lessons on a Friday.  The school suspended the lessons and the children returned to school.\nA second example is where an older generation of feminists (represented by JK Rowling) were confronted by angry activists for not supporting trans rights.  Rowling took to Twitter following a tweet that read “people who menstruate” instead of what she should thought should be “women who menstruate” and then went to add “If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. . . . I do not believe it’s hateful to say so.” (NY Post, 2020).  This tweet resulted in thousands of replies declaring Rowling a transphobic, bigoted TERF (trans-exclusion radical feminist) and impact of globalisation and different cultures and their values.\nSome of the factors that contribute to these differences are identified through Demographic methods (DEMOG).  Recent political surveys have shown huge generational differences between how older and younger adults view issues from climate change, through to Brexit and immigration and up to how we should respond to the pandemic.  However gender differences are more nuanced such as where the majority of white women voted for Trump to be elected, compared with less among white men.\nEconomic factors can also influence perceptions and views across society.  For example, automation can cost jobs, or improve productivity.  Which way do you think it will go?  The world of work has been changing significantly over the last few years, but Covid has also speeded this up with more hybrid and home working.\nGlobalisation is another factor that has significantly impacted sustainability and responsible business practice as it focuses on the key context for business practice such as through imports, exports and business location.  Globalisation has seen businesses being able to buy, sell and produce goods across the world, sometimes buying materials at a lower cost or producing where labour is most experienced or even cheaper to help with their own bottom line.  Globalisation is a topic that we will review throughout this module and each of the weeks to come.\nThe image below shows the largest container ship, which represents an emblem of the steady growth in international trade since the mid-90s, when the Word Trade Organisation, the global body dealing with the rules of trade, was established.   Up to 2021 the value of global trade had reached a record level of $28.5 trillion which was an increase of 25% on 2020 and 13% higher than 2020 (Unctad, 2021). \n\nFig1:  World Trade Organisation (2020)\nEven more dramatically, since 1950 we have seen a total increase in trade volumes of 4220%.  So what does this mean for you, your organisation and sustainability and responsible business practice?\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment and is as important as making and growing the organisation.  Organisations need to be productive without negatively impacting people, the planet or the environment and one way they  can do this is through ethical behaviour.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\nv1.2 Ethics and the Law\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.2 Ethics and the Law\n\nBusiness ethics is the study of business situations, activities and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed such as through how different organisations treat their customers, their staff, the planet and even their suppliers (Crane and Matten, 2016).  They are interrelated terms that can exist separately although most ethical considerations and are usually legally enforceable.  They describe the ways business should behave. It provides the social, cultural, legal and economic limitations to protect the interests of various stakeholders.  It also emphasis moral and social values such as welfare, consumer protection and fair business practices.   For example, thinking about the introduction of the government policy relating to plastic shopping bags.  This policy was to emphasis sustainability and to protect resources for future generations as well as reducing the use of single-use carrier bags to encourage people to reuse bags.  The scheme has so far worked as there has been a reduction of supplied single-use carrier bags  by over 95% and the money raised has totalled nearly £180m for good causes.\nBusiness needs to operate ethically to be successful and they need to create their own ethical business practices (EBP) which includes a culture where individuals in the business make decisions and act in ways that build sustainable business.  They also need to show a care for all the needs of the stakeholders working within these ethical and legal guidelines. Organisations that demonstrate unethical behaviours are usually named and shamed on social media sites and research has shown that up to 50% of customers are concerned with unethical businesses practices and are therefore prepared to move their business to more ethically proven business.  \n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.3 Globalisation\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.3 Globalisation\n\nAccording to Scholte (2005) globalization is not:\n‘internationalization’\n‘liberalization’\n‘universalization’\n‘westernization’\nGlobalization is a process which diminishes the necessity of a common and shared territorial basis for social, economic, and political activities, processes, and relations  and can result in deterritorialization (where a territory has its organisation destroyed through growth of cultural flows).   As we have seen earlier, globalisation has intensified since 1989 and this has  been caused by the collapse of the Eastern Block (former communist states in East and Central Europe eg Soviet Union, Albania, Yugoslavia for example) in 1989 when the cold war came to an end and the Berlin Wall came down.  This resulted in wider range of countries opening their borders and allowing people to escape to the West.   China has also contributed to global wealth during this time through foreign investment resulting in it boosting its exports of technology and capital which has allowed it to grow to be the second largest economy after the US. \nThere are many organisations that have benefitted from globalisation, and I imagine you can name a few.  However, one of the organisations that has benefitted from this is Nike who has manufacturing plants in almost every country of the world except Russia, most of African and some of the Middle East.  Nike’s set up factories across the world and now employ over 1.02 million workers in 42 countries to produce all its products.  29% of its products are made in China and 44% in Vietnam.  Only 76,000 of employees are actually employed by Nike.  However through globalisation Nike has been able to extend is sale of products and services from US to all over the world developing its brand and economic success. \n\n\nEconomically, there are gains, but how are these gains distributed across the different countries of the world?\nInterestingly, Switzerland, Ireland and Holland are in the top 3 countries across the world that have benefitted in terms of growth of income with Ireland being one of the most globalised economies.  The globalisation index by the Bertelsmann Foundation measures economic, political and social aspects of worldwide network economies and ranks countries overall.  Ireland has increased its globalisation rating due to its favourable climate, its central location between North America and Asia and its tourism appeal.  Ireland has also attracted foreign investment through these positive characteristics but also through having the population who are fluent in English.  The republic of Ireland has been a full member of the EEU and therefore been able to position itself well, particularly in relation to Brexit.  It also has low population density which means that there is room for growth.\nGlobalisation has allowed for free trade; it has lowered or abolished tariffs which has  increased the movement of labour and goods across several countries.  This has allowed organisations to focus on an area in which it represents competitive advantage such as through lack of regulation of global financial or cheaper labour.  Shareholders have sometimes looked at profit over ethical working practices, and example of this is Primark. In 2009, Primark were found to be employing illegal workers and paying their staff less than the minimum wage by using child labourers to produce their garments in refugee camps in Southern India.  The working conditions were very poor, but this child labour enabled Primark to grow through cheap production costs in a country outside of the UK.  This negatively impacted their brand and Primark has worked hard to rectify these poor practices over the last few years by signing up to an Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI’s) base code of labour practices based aligned to the International Labour Organisation standards.  This is an example of where Primark was able to outsource production to developing countries in order to reduce their costs in the global marketplace.  This has been positive as it provides jobs in these developing countries, but it also raises the potential for exploitation of employees through poor working conditions.  More than this, jobs in industrialized regions of developed countries have been put at risk, something which Donald Trump talked about very effectively in the 2016 US election. \nGlobalization can bring cheaper prices to consumers, but vulnerable consumers in developing countries may also face the possibility of exploitation by Multinational Corporations (MNCs).  These products can provide social benefits to consumers; however this can also be met with protests about cultural imperialism and westernization in less wealthy countries.   Global business activity brings the company in direct interaction with local communities and has the possibility of raising the erosion of traditional community life.\n\nGlobally active pressure groups emerge with aim to “police” corporations in counties where governments are weak and corrupt.  One example of global pressure groups is Greenpeace.  It was formed in 1971 to protect natural resources.  They are currently working with others to protect our natural world due to rising sea levels, extreme weather as the climate breaks down through destructive industries which pollutes forests, oceans and the air.  In 2020, they protested against Shall Oil and their plan to pollute the North Sea by abandoning an estimated 11,000 tonnes of oil on the sea.  The protestors on the Greenpeace Ship, Esperanza approached a 500m exclusion zone of Shell’s platform waving banners and calling on Shell to clean up its mess. \n\nFigure 2:  Greenpeace at Brent Oil Rigs (The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site.)\nShell wanted to dismantle these platforms in the sea as cheaply as possible, putting profit before people, however Greenpeace insisted that these platforms must be removed in an environmentally friendly manner.   You can read more about the Brent Story and Shell’s sustainability here - The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site..  As at March 2022 a decision is on the way but as, yet this has not been published.\nGlobalization weakens governments and increases corporate responsibility, for example, jobs, welfare, maintenance of ethical standards through increased budgetary pressures. Globalization confronts governments with corporations from regions with different cultural expectations about issues such as bribery, corruption, taxation, and philanthropy and decisions have to be made how to co-operate in an ethical and legal way, for example when organisations try to bribe the local government officials to accept their plan for redevelopment of premises, for example which is not in the best interests of the local community.\n\nHowever, globalization is good for all of us as it provides us with a much wider range of products and services and access to experiences we would not have in our own country.  However, turning our backs on globalization would take us down the wrong path.   It is the emerging and developing countries which have achieved only below average levels in the globalization index thus far and therefore still have great potential to globalize. By doing so, they could generate correspondingly high globalization-induced growth effects. This is why it is essential that emerging countries become better integrated into the global economy. In industrialized countries, it is necessary to spread the benefits of globalization more widely so that social acceptance of an open society is not lost.” Overall, if globalization (measured by various indicators) increases by 1%, there is a .33% increase in GDP.    You can read more about the global index here:  https://kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2021/12/kof-globalisation-index-2021.html#:~:text=The%20KOF%20Globalisation%20Index%20measures,the%20period%201970%20to%202019Links to an external site..\nThere is, however, considerable variation in impact on inequality in the developed world.  Broadly, in the US and UK, inequality has risen with globalization. In continental Europe and Japan, it hasn’t.  For example,  Equal Opportunities legislation has tried to target and ensure procedural justice is promoted through best practices and prosecuting those that do not comply.  In addition, pressure groups have grown in recent years attempting to address the social imbalances such as the Black Lives Matter movement who were founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer.  Their mission has been to eradicate white supremacy and build local power or to intervene in violence which is inflicted on Black communities.  This group has gained momentum through the murder of George Floyd and the group is being supported by celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton.   This is an example of a group that tries to advance the rights of under-represented individuals. However, there are many more.\nOrganisations have to comply with equal opportunities legislation such as the Equality Act 2010 in the UK and ensure for example during the recruitment practices, policies are fair and do not discriminate applications based on eg sex, race, age, religion etc.  Job descriptions need to be produced which provide fair criteria which applicants can be assessed against and use wording that does not discriminate applications, for example “only white males need to apply”.\nOnce individuals have been employed in an organisation then training programmes need to be open and fair to all of them, for example running programmes at a time of day that part-time staff can attend.  Organisations must ensure that they do not prioritise certain staff over others in terms of promotion to senior positions, particularly those from discriminated groups. \nOrganisations have moved to more diversity workforces and organisations like M&S and Metropolitan police have used targeted campaigns in London to try and address racial inequality through promoting equal opportunity for all, although they have had to be careful to ensure recruitment is still fair to all.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\n\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment, and it seeks to promote best practices to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources when developing products and services.   In 2022 we have seen souring temperatures across the UK and wildfires caused through climate change.  Organisations need to develop products and services without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs such as eg combating the o-zone layer (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)\nSustainability refers to the long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic and social considerations. \nOne of the ways to do this is through the triple bottom line:\n\nFigure 3:  Triple Bottom Line\nThe Triple bottom line model discussed by John Elkington in 1984 moved away from businesses focussing solely on financial performance but looked at people, planet and profitability which provided organisations with insight into the connections between environmental health, social wellbeing and the organisations financial success.\nThe traditional bottom line – profit – is supplemented by novel ways of accounting for an organisation's performance with respect to:\nPeople. How does the organisation stand in its treatment of employees, customers and the wider community? Is it doing all it can to maximise its performance in these areas?\nPlanet. How well is the organisation doing in its treatment of the natural environment? Is it using more resources than it needs to? Is it damaging the environment, through pollution or through making products, with poor environmental performance?\nAs we might expect from a model based on accounting, the triple bottom line model is particularly useful in providing checklists of areas of sustainability performance which an organisation should examine carefully.\nThe triple bottom line model can usefully be applied to all profit-making organisations and can also prove useful for non-profit organisations as well. For example, the diagram above has a close fit, in many areas, to the activities of an organisation like Anglia Ruskin University, since we have to pay attention to nearly all of the items listed in the diagram above – apart from total shareholder return.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.5 Covid-19\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.5 Covid-19\n\nSo what about the pandemic? What implications are there for business ethics?  Through the government measures to stem the spread of coronavirus some companies have positively put their employees before their profits ensuring both staff and customer safety as an overwhelming priority.  They have also cut executive pay rather than avoiding rising costs to customers. \nHowever, the government has bailed out companies on the brink of bankruptcy and has propped up wages of workers through furlough scheme which impacts organisations and society and does bring a question in terms of the balance of fairness. Organisations such as Netflix stated they would stop charging inactive customers and Unilever pledged to stop targeting children with adverts. Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on jobs, profits, trade and movement and even 4 years later travel is still a long way from where it used to be, however it has brought some positives in terms of hybrid working for employees, but this has also been at a cost to the high street.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 –Introduction to Sustainability & Responsible Business > 1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\n\nHere are 8 reasons why business ethics is a vital subject.  \nThese are:\nIt has power and influence of business in society\nPotential to provide major contribution to society\nPotential to inflict harm\nIncreasing demands from stakeholders\nLack of business ethics education or training\nContinued occurrence of ethical infractions\nEvaluating different ways of managing business ethics\nInteresting and rewarding\nCan you add any others?\nTherefore, throughout this first study week you have been introduced to some of the key concepts of sustainability and responsible business and the importance of ethical business practices.\n\nTopic 1\n\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nSocial\nPolitical\nCultural\nDemographic\nEconomic\nEquality\nDivisions\nPrejudice\nGenerational\nInequality\nFairness\nInstitutions\nXenophobia\nGender\nCSR\nMobility\nDemocracy\nRacism\nMigration\nBad practice\nVulnerability\nAccountability\nReligion\nWar\nTechnology\n \nTrade\nTraditions\nFamine\nGrowth\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761a8e-20564-Topic_3.docx ---\n3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Crisis > 3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\n\nThe United Nations was founded in 1945 with 51 original Member States and this international organisation is comprised of 193 Member States today.  The UN defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations.  The UN set up a commission to review the problems of economic development where global resources are limited.  Economists argued that economies could not grow as natural resources were finite and were becoming more difficult to obtain.  Therefore, if economic activity was to be 'sustainable' into the far future, more attention would have to be paid to rate at which resources were consumed. The World Commission on Environment and Development, headed by the Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, examined this problem in depth, and set out some basic principles for sustainable economic development and global justice in that Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nThe concept of sustainable development does imply limits, not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology and social organisation on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities. But technology and social organisation can be both managed and improved to make way for a new era of economic growth.” (Brundtland et al, 1987, Section 3., Paragraph 27).\nSustainable development lies in three principal pillars of: \nsocial progress – creating a just and equitable society\neconomic growth - creating an economy that provides a high standard of living for all people and allows everyone to participate fully in the workforce\nenvironmental protection - use of natural resources which does not compromise the health and well-being of future generations. It focuses on being mindful of finite resources, such as minerals and precious metals while ensuring that what we manufacture from them does not cause harm to all lifeforms on Earth.\nThe UN has developed the 2030 Agenda,  “For People for Planet” and a blueprint for a more sustainable future for all people across the world by 2020 (Mission Statement of the SDGs).  Today this includes 17 goals and 169 targets aiming to eradicate poverty and to heal and secure the planet.\nRather than simply talking about ‘sustainability’, it has become more common to speak of ‘sustainable development’. This move is driven by the recognition that, globally, we are nowhere near the conditions for true sustainability, and that we need to develop in directions that bring sustainability closer.\nTo this end, the United Nations have marshalled an effort to define and address a set of sustainable development goalsLinks to an external site. which represent the highest priority next steps to take on the path to sustainability. The UN SDGs are a sort of modern, extended definition of the Brundtland formulation that we have already examined.\n\nTopic 3\nPrevious\nNext\n3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Crisis > 3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\n\nThe United Nations was founded in 1945 with 51 original Member States and this international organisation is comprised of 193 Member States today.  The UN defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations.  The UN set up a commission to review the problems of economic development where global resources are limited.  Economists argued that economies could not grow as natural resources were finite and were becoming more difficult to obtain.  Therefore, if economic activity was to be 'sustainable' into the far future, more attention would have to be paid to rate at which resources were consumed.

Some suggestions:\nGood health and well-being - all organisations who care about their employees, health-related organisations such as the pharmaceutical industry.\nSustainable cities and communities - the construction industry, local government.\nLife on land - agriculture and agribusiness, any potentially polluting industry.\nEducation - Anglia Ruskin University is concerned with this one, as are all of your organisations in supporting your study here.\nWhen you examine the goals more deeply you will see that they interconnect, and that almost any organisation needs to pay attention to a large number of them.\nA goal without well-considered plans and actions underpinning it is worth very little, and the SDGs are supported by a knowledge base Links to an external site.and an unfolding set (a very large one) of initiatives.\nWe could spend the entire module looking at the UN SDGs, but unfortunately, we do not have enough time for that.

The 8 goals were realistic and easy to communicate, with a clear measurement and monitoring mechanism.   However, in 2012 UN developed a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)s to fit the global development framework beyond 2015.  This created a new people-centred, development agenda and engaged citizens, scientists, academics and private sector in the process and created 17 new goals:\n\nFigure 2:  UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2015)\n\n3.4 Climate Change\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals & the Climate Crisis > 3.4 Climate Change\n\nClimate change is already impacting public health, food and water security, migration, peace and security. Climate change, left unchecked, will roll back the development gains we have made over the last decades and will make further gains impossible.  The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) outlined some agreements in terms of the global agenda on climate change for the next decade and the\nCountries agreed to:\nmeet further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide to try to keep temperate rises within 1.5oC\nreduce the use of coal\nincrease money to poor countries to help with effects of climate change\nphase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or natural gas\nUS and China to cooperate and switch to clean energy\nstop deforestation by 2030\nClimate change impacts our food in terms of weather conditions such as increase in temperatures and rain fall which impact the quality of our foods, such as flooding the fields and destroying the crops.  Mortality rates can increase due to impact of food availability and can limit worker productivity.  Flooding can spread disease and damage the ecosystem and therefore, lowering emissions is believed to be one of the biggest impacts on lessening harmful impacts to health. \nIn 2021, the UN reported that more than 59 million people were displaced within their homelands through weather related events such as floods, storms and cyclones. \n\nFigure 4:  Unocha:  A displaced persons camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nOrganisations that revisit production practices and work on reducing emissions through good practices will help overcome some of the challenges with climate change.  Governments can help address social problems such as through global financial markets, climate and the internet and therefore there are many areas of business that are not explicitly regulated.  There is expectation that businesses will address these volatile financial markets, consider climate change during their production processes and consider issues such as internet privacy. \nRead the case study on page 133 of the core text “the politics of the oil sands” and the different stances of both the US and Canadian governments and the impact this is having on climate change.\n\nTopic 3\nPrevious\nNext\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nGoal 1\nEradicate extreme poverty and hunger\nGoal 2\nAchieve universal primary education\nGoal 3\nPromote gender equality and empower women\nGoal 4\nReduce child mortality\nGoal 5\nImprove maternal health\nGoal 6\nCombating HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other diseases\nGoal 7\nEnsure environmental sustainability\nGoal 8\nDevelop a global partnership for development\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nGoal 1Links to an external site.\nEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere\nGoal 2Links to an external site.\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture\nGoal 3Links to an external site.\nEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\nGoal 4Links to an external site.\nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all\nGoal 5Links to an external site.\nAchieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\nGoal 6Links to an external site.\nEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\nGoal 7Links to an external site.\nEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all\nGoal 8Links to an external site.\nPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all\nGoal 9Links to an external site.\nBuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation\nGoal 10Links to an external site.\nReduce inequality within and among countries\nGoal 11Links to an external site.\nMake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\nGoal 12Links to an external site.\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns\nGoal 13Links to an external site.\nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\nGoal 14Links to an external site.\nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development\nGoal 15Links to an external site.\nProtect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss\nGoal 16Links to an external site.\nPromote peaceful and inclus\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761c02-20564-Topic_4.docx ---\n4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\n\nThe actions that consumers take have an impact other people and those impacts can be positive or negative.  This is an example of a tweet that appeared discussing some of the problems with Amazon’s same delivery service and the impacts this has on the workers to search for, find and deliver products and services the same day. There are also the environmental impacts such as additional pollution in the environment.  Read the tweet below and then consider the questions below:\n\nWhen you order something for same day delivery do you consider the impact this has on workers or the environment and if so, would it persuade you to consider not same day deliver?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\nv4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\n\nOne of the key ethical tensions is between consumer rights versus the consequences of these activities.  The Declaration of Independence gave three examples of inalienable rights which were, to “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness”.  Sometimes these are known as natural rights.  Therefore, it is important to consider the following questions:\ndo consumers have a right to a product if the consequences of this are bad for society and/or the environment?\ndo consumers have a right to a product at a fair price?\ndo consumers have a duty to favour ethical companies in their purchasing decisions?\nObviously, the answer to some of these questions such as fair price is yes, however the consequences of this needs to be considered, e.g., is the fair price due to unfair labour practices such as child workers or paying below the minimum requirements then is it fair?\nConsumers have inalienable entitlements to fair treatment when entering into exchanges with sellers and there is a belief that consumer dignity should be respected.  Sellers have a duty to treat consumers as ends in themselves and not only as means to the end of the seller.  This should prevent misleading or deceptive practices and should aggregate social, cultural and environmental good practices.  These should therefore reduce inequality, exploitation, physical, emotional, mental and socio-cultural harm. \n\nThinking of tourism as an industry which includes human behaviour, the use of resources, communication with people, economies, the environment and the physical movement of the tourists to location impacts a number of different communities in both positive and negative ways. \nPositively tourism brings money into the community, can help with job creation, brings investment and triggers economic growth. \nNegatively it impacts the environment in terms of pollution, the ecosystem in terms of use of water taken e.g., for swimming pools from other needed community sources or through the clearing of vegetation for hotels and resorts to build these near beaches or in core areas of the forest.  Walking can trample and destroy coastlines leading to a loss of species and destruction of habitats.   Cultural diversity can also be reduced, and this is known as cultural homogenisation which refers to the reduction in cultural diversity through popularisation and diffusion of cultural symbols or customs, ideas and values which become absorbed by the dominant outside culture.\n An example of this is McDonalidization where fast food restaurants are dominating around the world meaning that the same health standards are being adopted across the world and therefore this can have a negative impact on health and are changing the food choices of the country before McDonalidization.\nCrane et al., 2019, identified a number of ethical issues for consumers within key industries as shown below:\n\nFigure 1:  Ethical issues for consumer within key industries.\nCan you think of any others? \nOrganisations need to deal with consumers ethical such as ensuring product safety and fitness for purpose or making sure during marketing activities there are no misleading claims or price fixing for example. \n\nOne of the issues that consumers criticise companies of is pricing.  Consumers want to purchase these as at the lowest cost, but companies want to sell these for the maximum amount to increase their revenue.  In most countries, regulatory agencies police price fixing – however the main issues that are arise are:\nExcessive pricing – price gouging – that the fair prices for goods and services has been exceeded.  This may be based on market conditions.\nPrice fixing – collusion between competing firms to fix prices above the market rate – this is illegal in Europe and US but other countries of the word it can go unnoticed.\nPredatory pricing – anticompetitive practice when firm sets the price significantly lower than market rate to force out the competition.\nDeceptive pricing – true cost is deliberately obscured and sometimes the airline industry has been found to advertise prices which are only available on a few flights with substantial booking restrictions and no information about the additional taxes or charges.\nHave you experienced any of these practices?  What do you think?  How ethical are these companies?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\n\nTwo theories can be applied to consumers and the consequences of actions.  The first is deontological ethics which applies to consumer rights as it provides an underlying principle of an action that is good or right?  It assumes that good decisions are made by adhering to ‘good’ principles and doing the right thing because it is the right thing to do.  If you follow rules and fulfil duties. \nDeontological ethics relies on the normative theory that morality of action is based on whether the action is right or wrong rather than based on the consequences of the action, for example do not kill, do not steal, follow religious beliefs and keep promises made. \nHowever, in contrast,  teleological ethics consider the consequences of actions and if they are morally the best (or consequentialist ethics).  For example, killing for promotion is wrong but killing in self-defence could be deemed as moral and the right decision made on the best consequences.  It therefore considers the outcome of the action good being good and whether the goal of the action or decision leads to good outcomes.  Overall, the better outcomes an action produces, the better it is.\nThis image shows the differences between the two:\n\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\n\nAs you have already started to see, consumers have various rights when purchasing goods and services and in the UK they are protected by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  This act gives the consumer a legal right to a refund for goods or services that are unsatisfactory or unfit for use or to get it repaired in certain circumstances.\nIn 2009, Tata Motors introduced a new model, The Tata Nano and described it as ‘The People’s Car’  with a price of around £1,075 at launch, with the price dropping by 30% within a year.  It was stated to be safer than alternative models of transport such as motorbikes, scooters, motor-rickshaws, and it was a lot cheaper.  It therefore potentially satisfied millions of lower-income people dream of owning a car. \nHowever, on the other hand, it was potentially ‘socially and environmentally disastrous’ as it was bringing countries to gridlock through increased traffic, pollution was impacted through the use of motor vehicles, damaging the environment.  In addition, the land for Nano factories had  been acquired controversially as some of the land had previously been the ‘most fertile’ farmland in locality.\nHowever, in 2010 reports emerged of fires in a handful of Nanos, amid wider concerns that cost-cutting made the car unreliable and safe, and it was discontinued in 2020 due to safety concerns. \nConsider the following question:\nDo people in developing countries have the right to products available to developed countries if these will have net negative consequences for society / the environment?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\n\nThis was one of the questions highlighted earlier – do you think consumers do have the right to a fair price?\nConsumers do have the right to a fair price and as we have seen in earlier topics, employers and employees can conflict during the production process as employers want to minimise costs and maximise revenue through reduced costs such as lower wages resulting in tensions between consumers and producers to maximise this cost revenue.   An example of this is that in 2015, Martin Shkreli was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a 60-year-old life-saving drug by over 5000% overnight taking the costs from $13.50 to $750 in the USA and by comparison it costs $0.66 in the UK.  His company had a monopoly on the drug, and this was not the first-time aggressive pricing has been brought in.  However even 2.5 years later the price hadn’t changed but the company was trying to make it less expensive to hospitals.   He was solely motivated by profits and was successful as there was no alternative to the drug for low-income patients.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.6 Ethical Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.6 Ethical Consumption\n\nProfessor Craig Smith, in 1995 and 1996 published research relating to ethical consumption and how consumers were boycotting unethical companies showing how customers do take ethical considerations into purchasing decisions.    Thinking  back to the child workers and poor labour practices in the production of Primark’s clothing, customers could have boycotted Primark until they resolved these unethical practices.\nHowever, boycotting unethical companies was found not to be consistent, and companies could justify unethical consumption.  Think about chocolate production and how Fairtrade was introduced.  Fairtrade is about better prices, safe working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers.  Fairtrade ensures that workers are paid fairly and providing better terms of the farmers.  Would you boycott a company that was producing chocolate unethically?  Would the companies survive?\nIn perfect competition (where  in a market buyers and sellers are so numerous and well informed that all elements of monopoly are absent and the market price of a commodity is beyond the control of individual buyers and sellers), customer demand drives market. \nThis means that the customer is King, and the customers will move to a different seller if they are not satisfied.  Therefore, is consumer sovereignty the ‘Key’ to truly ethical consumption? \nA consumer sovereignty test can measure:\nconsumer capability to make free decisions without vulnerability or coercion.\nhow readily available, good quality information is relating to products.\nchoice between similar products with affordable switching costs.\nHaving the capability to choose between similar products, with good information about companies’ ethical stances enables consumers to make choices such as where there has been any animal testing, or the products have been produced in a sweatshop or used child labour.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\n\nDisaster capitalism refers to the development of profits based on some type of disaster.   For example, Donald Trump proposed a $700 billion dollar stimulus plan to eliminate payroll taxes which would lead to a reduction in social security funding.  Some other governors said that they wanted nothing to do with this plan as it was too expensive and how it would impact state and local funding as it was to divert the funds.  Sometimes, unethical conduct can pay more than ethical conduct, however in this case the plan was not implemented. \nAnother example is from Nathan Rothschild (c.1815), who said, “The best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.”  He made his fortune buying in the panic following the Battle of Waterloo as the better the opportunities, the better the profit. \nHowever, Warren Buffet warned that you can pay a high price in the stock market, particularly if everyone agrees with your investment decision.   Therefore, where there is social and economic turmoil this results in an opportunity and can lead to prospective business deals.  Consumers and citizens maybe too tired or distracted of what is happening to resist the changes.  This leads to the debate about ethical and unethical behavior.\nDo you think it is ethical to profit from the pandemic? \nNews stories relating to the amount of government spending and the unethical contracts awarded by ministers has led to discussions relating to unethical behavior.  However, organisations such as Netflix and Amazon have clearly profited from the pandemic due to increased home shopping and people staying at home.   Billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic, with top executives from technology and industry earning the most. \nThe world's richest saw their wealth climb 27.5% to $10.2trn (£7.9trn) from April to July this year, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS.  That was up from the previous peak of $8.9trn at the end of 2017 and largely due to rising global share prices.  UBS said billionaires had done \"extremely well\" in the Covid crisis and it also said the number of billionaires had hit a new high of 2,189, up from 2,158 in 2017.  However, it is expected that 150 million people, have been predicted to fall into extreme poverty next year, due to climate change, war, and now the pandemic, which is a new record.\nDo you think that companies should be rewarded for doing the right thing?  Should we not punish them for doing the wrong thing?  Are they doing the wrong thing?\nThinking about fast fashion, which is a business model that relies on cheap and speedy production of low-quality clothing which is rapidly produced and cycled in and out of the market quickly to meet new trends.  \nFashion brand Zara, coined the phrase stating it took them only 15 days to design, produce and sell garments in their stores.  This allowed them to develop more styles and to differentiate their fashion garments at a lower price through cheap and rapid production which is an example of encouraging excessive consumption. \nTheir business model encourages consumers to purchase cheap clothing and discard them quickly creating environmental problems through accumulating mountains of textiles and clothing every day, which are not biodegradable.\n After the deaths of 1,134 people during the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh Aleya Akter, a local union leader, expressed concerns that raising working standards in the country would cause businesses to pull out from the country.  He suggested that, as much as workers blame the brands for letting things get so bad in the first place, the last thing they want is for the industry to disappear”. \nThere are about 4 million garment workers and it’s impossible for them to get work anywhere else, because this is what they’re skilled to do. Not only are we asking for compensation for the brands, but we are also asking them: Do not walk away from us. Do not walk away from Bangladesh.\"\nCan consumers claim that their demand for fast fashion is ethical because it leads to jobs and investment in the developing world? \n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\n\nStudy Activity\nIn the 1970s South Africa and Apartheid was a system where legislation upheld segregation policies against non-white citizens.  Government policies were developed that discriminated socially, economically and politically against black majority.  However, these unethical practices called for international economic sanctions against South Africa, though these were not fully enforced.  This resulted in ‘Ethical’ companies which ceased business and some less ethical businesses continued.  Apartheid ended in the 1990s when FW de Klerk (South African president), repealed most of the social legislation, however racial segregation remained due to deeply entrenched in society.  Nelson Mandela was a key antiapartheid activist and the countries first black president. \nCoca Cola.docx\nActions\n \n\nRead through Coke and Pepsi’s response to apartheid.

The Ethical Consumer article focuses on Amazon's negative impact, especially its unethical practices like poor treatment of workers, environmental damage, tax avoidance, and data misuse. It takes a critical ethical stance, encouraging people to think beyond cheap prices and question the company’s actions. This reflects the moral absolutist or deontological stance mentioned in the lecture, where actions are judged as right or wrong regardless of the results.\nOn the other hand, the MoneySavingExpert article is more focused on deals and savings. It doesn’t talk about ethics—it simply helps people get the best prices on Amazon. This matches the consequentialist stance, where the outcome (saving money) is more important than how the company behaves.\nMy View on Amazon and Ethical Shopping:\nPersonally, I use Amazon sometimes, but I do feel uncomfortable about many of its practices, like worker mistreatment and avoiding taxes. I believe in ethical shopping, but I also know it’s not always easy or affordable. I try to buy from better companies when I can, especially for clothes, food, and home items.\nYes, I think some things are serious enough to boycott a company, like:\nModern slavery\nAnimal cruelty\nEnvironmental harm\nMistreating workers on purpose\nIf I know a company does these things and doesn’t try to improve, I would stop supporting them. I believe companies should care about people, animals, and the planet—not just profit.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1

and regulations\n\nThe government in the UK are elected for up to five years and they develop the legislation and codes of practices that businesses have to abide by to survive.  The Government include a variety of institutions and actors that operate at different levels and that share a common power to issue laws, specifically at transnational, national, regional and local level.  The legislation serves as a codification which relates to explicit rules of social consensus about what society regards as right or wrong. \nFor example, one of the latest Acts of Parliament that has been updated in 2021 is the UK Environment Act.  This legislation was introduced following Brexit as previous EU rules on water quality, clean air and environmental protects were at risk were covered by European legislation.   This act sets the targets for e.g., air quality and water quality and waste reduction.  In March 2022 Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) in the UK launched a consultation to identify longer term targets, however as there were problems with the consultation process, this was extended to the 27th of June.\nIn addition to legislation, individuals and organisations are government by regulation which are the rules that are issued by governmental actors and other delegated authorities to constrain, enable, or encourage particular business behaviors.  Regulation includes rule definitions, laws, mechanisms, processes, sanctions, and incentives and for example businesses are expected to provide transparent, consistent and comparable

a stakeholder in business\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, the government acts as the representative of citizens, and is expected to define the conditions which business must meet in order to operate, for example:\nWhat environmental laws to follow\nThe level of corporate taxation that organisations need to pay and.\nWhether one large company can merge with another\nThe aim of the government is to be re-elected, not just to serve its citizens and therefore is made up be elected individuals and these individuals have noble aims as they want to be re-elected in the future.  Their interests usually align with business to make business strong which should result in a booming economy, happy people with jobs and them having an income to spend across the community.  However they are also able to influence by competition in terms of education, health and entertainment such as through local authority owned theatres vs commercially owned or charitable theatres. \nThis image gives an outline as the government as a stakeholder of business:\n\n \nFigure 1:  Government as a stakeholder of business (Crane, et al., 2019, p482)\nOn the left-hand side of the image you will see that the government in principle represents an entire community since it is elected by the citizens of a certain town, region, country or even continent.  In this role as the elected representative of citizens’ interests.  This means that they define the conditions for the licence to operate of business as well as restricting and enabling business.  There is some debate about the degree of governmental responsibility for a functioning economy for example such as through laissez-faire vs. forceful role in industrial policy. \nOn the right hand of the image, the government have a self-interest to be re-elected and therefore they are very dependent on business and also compete with business.  In March 2022, the UK government has published significant reform proposals to drive change in competition and consumer law policy with the aim of boosting trade following Brexit.\nIt could be argued that the government has a conflict of interest between creating jobs and regulating business interests.  This image from Crane and Matten (2019) shows some of these relations and conflicts of interest as well as identifying some of the main sources of ethical problems which stem from fiduciary relation to society in general. \nThis shows Society on the right and the Government in the middle who are setting the standards and regulations in the UK to provide a stable environment for businesses to operate within. On the Right and in this stable environment business provides the taxes eg corporation, VAT etc to the government through providing employment and good work leading to growth in the economy.  Through business activities the government reviews how they can protect citizens in society such as through environmental regulations, paternity leave, minimum wage and other employment regulation and interventions.  These are signals from the government that they are looking after citizens and ensuring business protect Society.  However, the government are caught in the middle of conflicting demands in a bipolar situation.\n\nFigure 2:  Government between business and society interests (Crane et al, 2019, p.486)\nTherefore here we can see that business can have significant impact and influence on the implementation of government policies and business influence legitimacy and accountability are questioned.  Business can expect stable legal and economic frameworks, however if these demands interfere too much with their activities and leads to irresponsible lobbying and scrutiny in terms of accountability. \n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.3 Government choice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.3 Government choice\n\nStudy Activity\nSo governments have a choice in where they position themselves.   \nDo you think that the government is:\nPro business?\nFairness to workers?\nFairness to consumers?\nHow to balance these aspects?\nInterventionist or laissez faire?\nCan you think of any examples of each of these different choices that the government has to make?  Make a list of examples.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\n\nThe main ethical consideration arising from this situation is twofold as identified above:\nlegitimacy of business influence;\naccountability (Crane et al.,, 2019)\nBusinesses look to influence to government or public policy through legitimacy of business influences through corporate political activity and they do this through activities such as lobbying, political advertising, financial contributions, legal action and political campaigning.  \nYou will hear in the news how business have paid for government campaigns or have funded political parties in ways to lobby the government. \nFor example one of top Tory Party Donors in the UK in 2022 is JCB who donated over £2.5 million whilst Boris Johnson has been in power.  JCB Chairman has access to Boris Johnson’s top team as part of an elite “advisory board” who lobbied for early relaxation of lockdown measures inn 2020 and tax benefits for high net-worth individuals.  Others have been given public appointments or honours through giving donations.  Therefore business can have a significant influence on the implementation and direction of governmental policies. It is therefore no surprise that the issue of ‘public sector ethics has gained enormous momentum (Dobel 2007).\nIn terms of accountability to the public, one may contend that since the government acts as a representative of society’s interests, the public has a right to be informed about governmental decisions with other constituencies (such as business) and be able to determine whether it is acting in its interests or not.  Both parties are able to influence each other, the main concerns for business ethics are where business has influence on government.  There are numerous ways that business can influence government and Oberman (cited in Getz 1997, p59) distinguishes among different ways, using following criteria as to whether it is:\nThis gives different approaches to influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in 2008-9 as it had so many officials that had worked there from government posts.\nJapan has a tradition known as ‘Amakudari’, which means that Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high profile positions going into private and public sectors.  It means “descent from heaven”.  This example proved that in Japan, many contracts went to 70% of firms with links (no contest) to previous government bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you

telecommunication, rail and utilities for example.   In addition in the 1990s following the end of the USSR and the development of post-soviet transition from communism to capitalism there was massive scale investment in these countries which you have seen is where the growth of globalisation has come from.\nIn 2013, the Post Office in the UK was floated on the stock exchange through selling shares to private investors.  Representations from the firm, Lazard, were paid £1.5m by the government for flotation advice relating to the Post Office.  They followed their own recommendations and bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p to reap a profit of £8.4m.  Is this ethical?    One could argue no and their profit was based on insider information.\nDuring the pandemic we have seen that normal procurement rules were suspended and therefore this was open to cronyism. \nA report by the BMJ in 2021, identified that 1/5th of all UK government contracts contained a “red flag” which were indicators of possible corruption.   These contracts were worth £3.7 bn and it was identified that companies bidding for contracts were channeled through “VIP” or “high priority” channels because of their political connection and 30 contracts were awarded to companies with connections to the Conversative Party.  Is this ethical?\nGlobalization has made companies arguably more powerful than many governments.   Thinking about Amazon which is at no.55 if it was a country – ahead of oil rich Qatar and Walmart is bigger than Belgium.   Globalisation has enabled organisations to develop into poorer countries for example increasing their footprint in many countries, resulting in improving democracy to corrupting failed states to all in between.\nWhat moral duty do they have? \nFor example, Amazon and other organisation are able to avoid one tax regime in favour of another and the issue of trade and tariffs become paramount. \nIncreasingly, action on the environment is global and there is less room to hide.  You have to ask, what is the point of profiting in the next 10 years? \nBusinesses complained for centuries about red tape, and they are now making noise on ‘green tape’.  Oil companies spend $150m per year on lobbying against carbon reduction, $190 m saying they are the good guys, and $115bn on new extraction (3% on low carbon). \nHow ethical is this?\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.7 Activity 1 - Ethical Practices Case Study\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable

The key unethical behaviors mentioned in the paper include:\nFalse advertising – Companies give wrong or misleading information to customers to increase sales.\nExploitation of workers – Some firms underpay workers, give poor working conditions, or ignore labor rights.\nBribery and corruption – Businesses use bribes to win contracts or avoid legal rules.\nEnvironmental violations – Some companies ignore environmental laws and pollute just to cut costs.\nTax evasion – Firms avoid paying taxes through unfair or illegal means.\nThese unethical actions hurt not just the company’s image but also the market and the people. For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems. That’s why I believe ethical business is not only the right thing to do but also important for long-term success.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n28 May 17:09| Last reply 30 May 9:12\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the article by Rai and Deo (2017), it’s clear that some businesses still engage in really questionable behaviour. The paper talks about companies lying to customers through false advertising, treating workers unfairly, and using bribes to get ahead. What stood out to me was how common it still is for businesses to ignore environmental rules or avoid taxes just to save money. These actions might help them in the short term, but they seriously damage trust in the long run. Customers stop buying from brands they don’t believe in, employees become unhappy, and honest businesses find it harder to compete. It also puts a bad image on the whole industry. I think businesses need to realist that ethics and success go hand in hand—cutting corners might work for a while, but it always catches up with them.\n \n I completely agree with what you said about

Business > 5.1 Defining government, laws and regulations\n\nThe government in the UK are elected for up to five years and they develop the legislation and codes of practices that businesses have to abide by to survive.  The Government include a variety of institutions and actors that operate at different levels and that share a common power to issue laws, specifically at transnational, national, regional and local level.  The legislation serves as a codification which relates to explicit rules of social consensus about what society regards as right or wrong. \nFor example, one of the latest Acts of Parliament that has been updated in 2021 is the UK Environment Act.  This legislation was introduced following Brexit as previous EU rules on water quality, clean air and environmental protects were at risk were covered by European legislation.   This act sets the targets for e.g., air quality and water quality and waste reduction.  In March 2022 Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) in the UK launched a consultation to identify longer term targets, however as there were problems with the consultation process, this was extended to the 27th of June.\nIn addition to legislation, individuals and organisations are government by regulation which are the rules that are issued by governmental actors and other delegated authorities to constrain, enable, or encourage particular business behaviors.  Regulation includes rule definitions, laws, mechanisms, processes, sanctions, and incentives and for example businesses are expected to provide transparent, consistent and comparable information to investors and stakeholders in terms of environmental, social and corporate governance.  These areas are also coming under regulatory action such as corporate sustainability reporting or sustainable investment or sustainable financial disclosure.\nIn the UK we have a number of rregulatory bodies who ensure that rules and regulations are put into practice across business such as DEFRA, or the Forestry Commission or the Environment Agency. \nRegulation is enforced through imperative regulation, which means that government regulations are backed by sanction mechanisms, for example the police, military, courts and parliaments, which leads it to being strong way to enforce the rules. \nThe second method is through private regulation which is issued by companies, industry associations or civil society groups, and these may be binding, however sanctioning mechanisms being softer and more indirect such as company rules such as not creating a

5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, the government acts as the representative of citizens, and is expected to define the conditions which business must meet in order to operate, for example:\nWhat environmental laws to follow\nThe level of corporate taxation that organisations need to pay and.\nWhether one large company can merge with another\nThe aim of the government is to be re-elected, not just to serve its citizens and therefore is made up be elected individuals and these individuals have noble aims as they want to be re-elected in the future.  Their interests usually align with business to make business strong which should result in a booming economy, happy people with jobs and them having an income to spend across the community.  However they are also able to influence by competition in terms of education, health and entertainment such as through local authority owned theatres vs commercially owned or charitable theatres. \nThis image gives an outline as the government as a stakeholder of business:\n\n \nFigure 1:  Government as a stakeholder of business (Crane, et al., 2019, p482)\nOn the left-hand side of the image you will see that the government in principle represents an entire community since it is elected by the citizens of a certain town, region, country or even continent.  In this role as the elected representative of citizens’ interests.  This means that they define the conditions for the licence to operate of business as well as restricting and enabling business.  There is some debate about the degree of governmental responsibility for a functioning economy for example such as through laissez-faire vs. forceful role in industrial policy. \nOn the right hand of the image, the government have a self-interest to be re-elected and therefore they are very dependent on business and also compete with business.  In March 2022, the UK government has published significant reform proposals to drive change in competition and consumer law policy with the aim of boosting trade following Brexit.\nIt could be argued that the government has a conflict of interest between creating jobs and regulating business interests.  This image from Crane and Matten (2019) shows some of these relations and conflicts of interest as well as identifying some of the main sources of ethical problems which stem from fiduciary relation to society in general. \nThis shows Society on the right and the Government in the middle who are setting the standards and regulations in the UK to provide a stable environment for businesses to operate within.

has made companies arguably more powerful than many governments.   Thinking about Amazon which is at no.55 if it was a country – ahead of oil rich Qatar and Walmart is bigger than Belgium.   Globalisation has enabled organisations to develop into poorer countries for example increasing their footprint in many countries, resulting in improving democracy to corrupting failed states to all in between.\nWhat moral duty do they have? \nFor example, Amazon and other organisation are able to avoid one tax regime in favour of another and the issue of trade and tariffs become paramount. \nIncreasingly, action on the environment is global and there is less room to hide.  You have to ask, what is the point of profiting in the next 10 years? \nBusinesses complained for centuries about red tape, and they are now making noise on ‘green tape’.  Oil companies spend $150m per year on lobbying against carbon reduction, $190 m saying they are the good guys, and $115bn on new extraction (3% on low carbon). \nHow ethical is this?\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.7 Activity 1 - Ethical Practices Case Study\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable

The key unethical behaviors mentioned in the paper include:\nFalse advertising – Companies give wrong or misleading information to customers to increase sales.\nExploitation of workers – Some firms underpay workers, give poor working conditions, or ignore labor rights.\nBribery and corruption – Businesses use bribes to win contracts or avoid legal rules.\nEnvironmental violations – Some companies ignore environmental laws and pollute just to cut costs.\nTax evasion – Firms avoid paying taxes through unfair or illegal means.\nThese unethical actions hurt not just the company’s image but also the market and the people. For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems. That’s why I believe ethical business is not only the right thing to do but also important for long-term success.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n28 May 17:09| Last reply 30 May 9:12\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the article by Rai and Deo (2017), it’s clear that some businesses still engage in really questionable behaviour. The paper talks about companies lying to customers through false advertising, treating workers unfairly, and using bribes to get ahead. What stood out to me was how common it still is for businesses to ignore environmental rules or avoid taxes just to save money. These actions might help them in the short term, but they seriously damage trust in the long run. Customers stop buying from brands they don’t believe in, employees become unhappy, and honest businesses find it harder to compete. It also puts a bad image on the whole industry. I think businesses need to realist that ethics and success go hand in hand—cutting corners might work for a while, but it always catches up with them.\n \n I completely agree with what you said about how unethical behavi\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761f1a-20564-Topic_6.docx ---\n6.1 Perception of Facebook and Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.1 Perception of Facebook and Ethics\n\nFacebook was set up by Mark Zuckerberg with the mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and it could be argued that he has achieved this to some extent.  However they have been criticised for the way they use personal data, viewing history and their lack of safety at times. \nPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have pledged to give 99% of their wealth away via their eponymous initiative.  You might have read their letter to their daughter which appeared on Facebook just after she was born, and they also pledged to work towards no disease by the end of the century. \nYou’re probably familiar with Bill and Melinda Gates and their work on AIDS in Africa. \nThese are inspiring examples of how businesspeople use their wealth, created from personal sacrifice, hard work, and innovation, to help others.  However it isn’t always what it seems for example,  Facebook’s company base is in Ireland where corporate tax is 12.5% in comparison to Britain at 20%.  Any money the company has made has been routed from the UK through Ireland resulting in them only paying €3.4m in corporate taxes.  Facebook Ireland makes little profit because it makes huge royalty payments for using Facebook technology to another Irish company called Facebook Holdings Limited which is also based in Ireland, although its tax domicile is in the Cayman Islands which is tax-free.  This tax trick is known as the “double-Irish”.    In 2019 Facebook’s turnover in the UK was £1.6bn.  A relatively miserly 5% profit margin would have resulted in profits of £800m, and yet their declared profits were just £97m.\nHere we have another view of business, one in which the businessperson does all it possibly can to avoid paying what it rightfully should, stripping (for example) the UK of its citizens’ wealth, and stopping our government from tackling  poverty, disease and improving education.  This tax arrangement is said to have ended but we haven’t yet seen how much tax Facebook will pay.\nFacebook are not alone at these practices for example other Tech Giants such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and Cisco Systems have between them only paid £191m in taxes in the UK in 2017.  This was on a combined turnover of £23.42bn and estimated profits of £6.62bn, which would have meant them paying £1.068bn more than they did. \nIt could be argued that Britain’s businesses are sometimes misaligned with those of other stakeholders such as employees, customers, service users and local authorities. \nCo-operatives were established to achieve specific or organisational goals to share both risk and reward which means that they are more democratic and accountable and can’t sell equity on capital markets to influence shareholding conglomerates.  Recent studies have shown them to be more enduring and resilient in the face of market dispution, more profitable and more productive (Co-ops unleashed, 2022).\nHowever Britain’s top five co-operatives paid more in tax in 2016 than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks combined as shown in the image below:\n\nFigure 1:  Comparison of tax contributions (SEUK, 2018)\n\nIt is worth just reiterating what we mean by some key concepts in the economy and pointing to some differences.   As you will be aware the economy is split into two sectors –\nPrivate and Public:\nPrivate sector - Independent entities, owned by individuals or shareholders, and who are dependent on customers with outcome of being profit-driven\nPublic sector - Part of a larger whole and owned by the state, national or local. They are answerable to government and voters and have a clear social purpose\nPrivate companies are separate bodies.  They may of course take multiple forms, as we see from mergers and acquisitions all the time, but the very term corporation is derived from the Latin corpus which means body.  They are owned by one person, a few people, many people, or even by other corporations in the form of corporate investors etc.  They may be sole traders, owned and managed by one person, or the management may be appointed to run the company on behalf of the shareholders.  They are of course subject to the law of the land, but their duty is to shareholders, and their performance of that duty is dependent on how well they serve their customers. This generates profit, which is the primary purpose.\nWe can all think of public sector bodies, for example, the Job Centre, the local hospital, even the police or army.  Using that latter example, while the army is distinct from the navy or the air force, they are expected to pursue common objectives.  The armed forces collectively are also part of the state, along with all its other constituents, and they are all meant to be pulling in the same direction.  That direction is decided not by the market, but by governments, which are, of course, elected every 5 years, or more frequently at local level.  They have in common that private profit should not be their primary purpose.  However lean or efficient they might be, the profit (or savings made) is recycled elsewhere in the system rather than shared amongst a few owners.\nMost countries in the world operate a 'mixed economy', consisting of for-profit enterprises, and state-owned organisations.  These two parts of the economy are often referred to as the private and public sectors and are calibrated in different proportions in different states.  For example, in Denmark around 35% of jobs are in the public sector, while in South Korea the figure is only 7.6% (OECD, 2015). \nIn the UK, around 28 million people work in the private sector, which is almost 84% of the entire workforce (ONS, 2018).  There are 5.7 million businesses, which range in size from one person operations ('sole traders') to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) which employ from 10-250 people, up to large national and international corporations.  However, an additional 'third' sector also exists, made up of organisations and associations which are both separate from government and motivated by social objectives rather than private profit.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\nv6.2 The Third Sector\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.2 The Third Sector\n\nSo let’s compare third sector organisations (TSOs) with other sectors, using the features we looked at just now. \nThey are independent of the state, although they might get some funding from local or the national government, or they may be contracted by the NHS to do some work.  They are subject to the law as we all are.  But the government cannot (or should not) tell TSOs what to do. \nSo who owns them?\nThe confusing answer is that for the most part, no-one does, and everyone does. \nIf you look at charities, they are generally overseen by a board of what are called trustees.  They are responsible for directing things, and liable if things go wrong, but they don’t usually get paid, and they don’t share in any profit or surplus.  By the way, day to day management and operations are carried out by paid staff.  It’s not all voluntary. \nBusinesses answer to customers, the government to voters, TSOs to a diverse range of stakeholders, who can have a financial interest such as donors, grant givers, consumers (if they have shops, say) or businesses (if they sell services), even people who are about to die and make a bequest.  But they also answer to communities, and above all to the people or cause they serve.  A charity for disabled adults which wins substantial funding, runs efficiently, and employs dozens of staff will still potentially fail if they don’t serve their beneficiaries properly.\nAbove all, TSOs are motivated by this ‘serve’ mentality.  Social aims such as relief of poverty, protecting the environment, widening access to education, promoting healthy lifestyles, etc. They can’t lose money, or they’ll fail, but making a profit is not their purpose.\nThree key words for the constituents of this sector:\nCharity\nSocial Enterprises (recently rebranded Co-op group is our largest in this country), and\nVoluntary Organisations – the thousands of small entities like sports clubs, allotment societies, self-help groups, tenant’s associations and so on.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\n\n“The third sector includes organisations that:\nExist primarily for a social purpose\nAre independent of the state\nRe-invest financial surpluses in their services\nThe boundaries with the public and private sectors are not clear-cut and over time, organisations move across the boundaries.” \nThis is from Mike Hudson’s book Managing Without Profit. \nTraces history of charity (from a Greek word meaning favour, grace, kindness), which he argues goes back to earliest civilisations, whether it’s in Ancient Egypt, where ferries gave free passage to poor people, the Jewish or Muslim traditions of donating a proportion of your income to the needy, or Christian monks establishing the first hospitals here in England. \nIn many ways the first golden era for charity and philanthropy was the 19th Century, when many ‘household name’ charities were first established (Salvation Army, Barnardo’s, the RNLI, RSPCA, the Red Cross).  This continued up to the 1940s, when government (in the war and after) sought to replace many welfare services previously provided by charity.  Since the 1970s this process has been reversed, and the third sector delivers many public sector contracts, and had an income of over £100 bn in 2008.\nHudson points out the contested nature of the sector’s boundaries.  I would disagree with him, for example, that social enterprises form part of the private sector, as they are driven by social purpose and don’t distribute profits privately.\n\n“A useful way to define the third sector (and social economy) is that it comprises organisations where ‘shares’ of social wealth) are allocated to people in proportion to their needs and activities rather than property (private) or political (public) rights.” - A second definition from Ridley-Duff and Bull, 2011: p17\n\nRidley-Duff and Bull take a more wide-ranging, academic, and radical approach.  They highlight the fact that charitable activity predated the existence of the capitalist system, which only became properly established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nThey also point up two tensions within the third sector:\nNon-profit approach based primarily on giving, versus the ‘more than profit’ approach where SEs trade but do good things with their profits.\nSome organisations, most notably but not exclusively co-operatives, are based on principles of democratic control by members. For example a disability charity where the strategy is set by and for its beneficiaries or service users.  Others are run by one group of people for the good of others, with less democratic input from those they serve.\nThey set social purpose as the key definition, but neglect to mention independence explicitly.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.4 So what's a charity?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.4 So what's a charity?\n\nLet’s start with a charity.  Charity legislation in England goes back to 1603, and there are charities which still exist today which go back still further – there’s an alms house in Winchester which has been going since 1132. \nRoyal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) started in 1868.  Their purpose in a nutshell relates to the welfare of blind and partially sighted people, and the prevention of blindness.  Last year they spent over £123m which puts them in just about the top 20 in the UK.  They helped 17,000 people via sight loss advisers, over 60,000 with general advice, 12,000 with welfare advice, provided 20,000 talking books, and campaigned for safer streets, among other things.  They have 1500 employees and 4800 volunteers resulting in a wage bill of about £60m, and it is confirmed that the CEO earns around £150,000.\nSo charities can be big business. \nIn football club terms RNIB is like Everton or West Ham, in high street terms, a White Stuff.\n\nTopic 6\n6.5 Social Enterprises\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.5 Social Enterprises\n\n\nThe difference between social enterprise and charity is that social enterprises get most of their income from trading, but they are still motivated by social impact more than private profit.  And here’s examples of a social enterprise or two. \nLighthouse furniture is in Towieland, Brentwood.  They stop furniture going to landfill and provide low-cost furniture for low-income families so having two social aims.  They have just over 800k turnover, 80 odd employees and volunteers, and dramatic growth as they’ve doubled in size in 5 years.\nQuadrant here in Chelmsford is part of Chelmsford Star Co-operative, which has a £100m (Like a Burnley level) turnover retail co-operative owned by its customers.  They are committed to co-operative principles including democracy (members elect the board) and supporting the local community (equivalent of 20% of profits donated to good causes).\n \nConfusingly social enterprises can be charities too.  Lighthouse is one.  But Chelmsford Star isn’t.\nThere are some statistics below:\nYou can see that charity numbers, at least in E&W are fairly static, social enterprises are growing in number (and that growth is partly reflected in growth in co-ops). \nWe can’t leave this section with introducing food backs which have grown considerably across the UK particularly in 2022 and the cash crisis.  Food banks have seen their donations skyrocket by 5000% a month in 2020 with the average donation of approximately £1900.  The needs for foodbanks has grown across the UK and those that need access to this service can through vetting procedures.  This is an area of social enterprise that has significantly increased over the last few years.\nEton College\n\nEton College is a school in Eton, Berkshire in England and was founded in 1440 by Henry VI.  It has famously been attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, and other senior conservative prime ministers, for example.  However they have designated registered charity status.  Their charitable income includes fees, as these are raised in support of their purpose: education. \nThe fees are  £12,354 per term and therefore should they be a charity? \nFees, then generated £42m for the school and it has 646 employees and NO volunteers.  During the year 277 boys (21%) received fee reductions; 70 of these boys paid no fees at all. The equivalent figures for the previous year were 277 and 64. the amount spent on fee remission increased from £5,773k to £6,084k with the average award remaining 64% of the full fee.  It has £300m of assets, mainly property and investments.\nIn comparison, the Royal National Lifebook Institution (RNLI) is one of the biggest charities in the UK.  They are funded through donations, grants, legacies and account for £174m of its income of £192m.  It has 2200 employees and 33,000 volunteers.  It has saved 329 lives and helped 42,000 people in 2019.\nWhy should a charity do this?\nIs there any reason why the same could not apply to government bodies too? \nCSOs have a tradition of campaigning for legal reform, and against unfair policies or laws.  However, there are strict limits on charities, for example, campaigning for a particular party in an election\nHere are some ways in which CSOs take on this role:\nIndirect action often takes the form of research, communications, information, raising awareness about activities which are not seen as ethical.  So for example, an anti-obesity charity would campaign in the media and social media against fast food or soft drinks companies, as part of its general work. \nDirect action is riskier, can be violent (unlikely) or non-violent in nature.  If violent it is more likely to be property than people who get damaged.  But a group called SHAC (NOT registered charity) attacked Huntingdon Life Sciences with threats, violence and vandalism. They only stopped in 2014, after 15 years.  More often it’s like we see here with the Greenpeace boat in an earlier lesson.  However some of the ways they can cause disruption is through demonstrations, marches, letters, occupations, and boycotts.\nBoycotts are a form of ethical consumption, and organised refusal to buy services or goods.  So they:\nChange a policy\nGet a buzz around or against a company more generally\nCommunicate disapproval\nOr punish the company in their pockets\nIs this always a negative?  Can it be good for companies in the long run?\nCSOs or TSOs can challenge government as well as business. \nAnd of course the government can regulate and control business and TSOs in return.  However business complain of red tape, and charities find some of these regulations as e over burdensome such as having to report requirements attached to funding.  They also support and enable TSOs to thrive and here are some of the things being ‘traded’ between government and the sector. \nThe government is committed to tackling obesity, and charities exist with the same agenda.  They may not always agree, but some policy will chime with TSO campaigns. \nThe government can also provide a legislative framework broadly supportive of TSOs, which TSOs can support back.  If the government promotes volunteering, TSOs and CSOs can host events through providing volunteers.  This helps the government meet its own objectives (and maybe save money?)\nFinancially, in various ways: through buying their services; granting funds for projects or research; and lending, perhaps via social finance (more in a minute) .  In return, public trust (charities trusted more than govt, still), agility, flexibility, social innovation, access to ‘hard to reach’ people.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.6 Government Policy \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.6 Government Policy \n\nThe government launched Big Society Capital (BSC) in April 2012. Its purpose is to provide wholesale funding (investments, repayable) for charities and social enterprises to grow in scale, use as working capital, and buy assets to generate income.  Started with £120m, made up of ‘sorry money’ from UK banks, and money from dormant bank accounts.  By 2015, over 250 charities and social enterprise had accessed finance (from intermediaries) that BSC provided, which resulted in a total of £195m, of which BSC accounted for £68m from its own cash.\nThe conservative government proposed the Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support Bill) in 2021 and is currently passing through parliament.  This bill was to assess the benefits and effectiveness of TSOs and provide to support organisation’s function.    You can read more about this proposed bill here - Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support) Bill (parliament.uk)Links to an external site.. \nThe National Citizen Service (NCS) encourages socially meaningful volunteering and participation by young people.  Piloted by a social enterprise with 100 odd people in 2009, the government adopted it in 2010 and since then over 200,000 have signed up.  Clearly has an impact on the third sector.  It was mainly set up to encourage 16–17-year-olds to volunteer during the summer after their GCSEs.  \nThe conservative government introduced the “big society” plan in 2010 to empower communities, however it was ill-fated and was disbanded mainly due to the fact that it lacked funding and support.   The government now wants people to have a say at local level in terms of getting better facilities using a cross sector approach which is not just up to local government.  However for the social sector there is no big new pot of money and the total spend due to austerity measures has been in significant decline and many community projects have been abandoned. \nThe government launched the Social Value Act which came into force in 2013 with aim of ensuring wider social, economic and environmental benefits.  This allowed the government to ensure that contracts would be awarded to organisations where their social values could be evaluated, and the government departments would then report on the social impact of these contracts.  The Social Value Model provides a consistent approach for the departments to streamline and standardise the procurement process. \nLet’s now think about how business interacts more positively with CSOs.  Here are some ways.\n\nFigure 3:  How Business interacts with CSOs.\nOn the right of this image are some of the ‘paybacks’ the third sector can offer for these interactions such as through joint ventures and the sense of ‘exchange’ is greater and more formalised in the bottom half of this image. \nWe’re familiar with the great entrepreneurs and giving.  \nCarnegie was a captain of industry or robber baron depending on your viewpoint, made a fortune in steel in the 19th century in the US, sold out for $480 million, which is $310 billion today.  One of the richest men who ever lived, gave $350 million away.   He killed strikers in his steel plants and was responsible for the worst manmade disaster in US history at the South Fork Dam.  However, he built 3000 libraries, a university and his final $30 million was donated in his will to institutions, charities and pensioners.  \nHow do we place this along with modern individual figures like Gates and Zuckerberg in the context of business ethics? \nMore recently, an expectation is that companies themselves ‘give something back’.  For example, a firm has an office in Chelmsford, where its Foundation is also based.  It had profits in 2018 of £121m and it spent less than £1m on the foundation, although technically they don’t have to give it.  A further example is Omaze which is a fundraising platform which has enabled over 300 charities to raise over £100m.  They give back by doing world-changing work such as creating after school programmes for 17,000 children in Los Angeles or through raising funds for disaster relive in California fires.   Each year the entire organisation takes a break from their office jobs for an annual day of service where they volunteer with a local non-profit organisation and give back to the community.  Organisations in the UK are also doing this, and they reward their staff for community based voluntary activities.\nWhere would this fit in ethical theories? \nVery much a teleological approach – there is a purpose behind it.  You could say it was egotistical – the company doing good for its own purposes.   Hasn’t even been completely demonstrated that (e.g.) profits are linked to CSR.  So why bother? It can help with long term revenues, reduced costs, managing risk and uncertainty and maintaining the social licence to operate.\nCompanies who are seen as socially responsible might attract more customers, and irresponsible ones are likely to lose them, and their employees might be more productive.  For example, a focus on sustainability leads to reduced costs by saving energy or cutting down on waste and acting responsibly, and being perceived to do so, can reduce government interventions, and potentially prevent bad practice and associated costs.  Also it allows the company to operate, and potentially contributes to a stable, peaceful, and equitable environment in which to do so. \n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.7 Activity 1 – What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.7 What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\n\nDiscussion Activity - Contribute to the discussion\nThird sector and charitable organisations such as food banks have grown through Covid and current cash crisis in the UK.  Many governments funded projects are short-term and output focussed which fails to meet the needs or support citizens and communities and therefore sustainability is key for these organisations.\nThinking about your own experience of third sector organisations or through research how do you think Third Sector organisations can diversify their income, work more agile and work more with government policymakers to improve the lives of people in crisis?\nPost your comments  to the forum and respond to one of your peer’s posts.\n\nTopic 6\nReply\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n28 May 20:59| Last reply 30 May 9:07\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nDiversifying Income and Building Sustainability in the Third Sector\nThe growth of third sector and charitable organisations such as food banks during COVID-19 and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis reflects a deep and increasing need for community-based support systems. However, their heavy reliance on short-term, output-focused government funding undermines long-term impact and sustainability. From both research and experience, there are several ways in which these organisations can become more financially resilient, agile, and influential in policymaking:\n1. Diversifying Income Streams\nTo reduce reliance on time-limited public grants, third sector organisations can:\nDevelop social enterprises: Many charities are setting up business arms that offer goods or services while reinvesting profits into their core mission. For example, The Trussell Trust has partnered with retailers and tech firms to run donation-linked campaigns.\nCorporate partnerships: Strategic, values-aligned partnerships with private companies can provide long-term income and resource sharing.\nIndividual giving and legacy donations: Investment in digital fundraising platforms and awareness campaigns has helped some charities significantly grow their donation base.\nReference: NCVO (2023) highlights that charities with diverse income sources were more financially stable during the pandemic.\n(Source: National Council for Voluntary Organisations – www.ncvo.org.uk)\n2. Becoming More Agile\nAgility is key in responding to crises. This includes:\nInvesting in digital infrastructure: Enabling remote support services, managing data more effectively, and enhancing communication.\nCollaborative working models: Pooling resources with other third sector groups or local authorities to avoid duplication and increase efficiency.\nUpskilling volunteers and staff: So they can adapt quickly to changing demands and service needs.\n3. Working With Government Policymakers\nThird sector organisations must play a more active role in influencing social policy:\nData-driven advocacy: Charities often hold unique frontline data about poverty, food insecurity, and housing. Sharing this with policymakers can shape better-targeted interventions.\nInclusion in long-term planning: Instead of being seen as emergency responders, charities should be embedded in local and national resilience strategies.\nDemonstrating outcomes: Providing robust evidence of impact, beyond output metrics, helps justify sustained investment and policy support.\nConclusion\nFor the third sector to continue meeting rising community needs, especially during economic hardship, it must move towards income diversification, operational agility, and proactive policy engagement. Only then can it provide sustainable, long-term support to the most vulnerable.\nReference; \nNational Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO, 2023).\nThey provide insights and data on how UK charities managed through COVID-19 and economic uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of income diversification for financial sustainability.\nCitation:\nNCVO.

However, one of the biggest challenges is that many of these organisations rely on short-term or project-based government funding, which often limits their long-term impact and planning.\nTo move forward, I believe third sector organisations must shift their focus towards resilience and long-term capacity-building, rather than just reacting to crises.\nOne way to strengthen their stability is by building community-led income models. This means not only accepting donations but involving local communities in creating solutions — like community cafés, repair shops, or thrift stores — that generate income while serving a social purpose. These types of micro-initiatives empower people locally and reduce dependency on external funding.\nAnother approach is for these organisations to build stronger alliances with local authorities and other nonprofits. Often, many organisations work in the same area but separately. By collaborating more closely and sharing resources like office space, training, or volunteers, they can reduce costs and strengthen service delivery.\nIn terms of policy influence, the third sector should use evidence and data from the people they serve to push for policy change. Many smaller charities don’t realise how valuable their on-the-ground insights are. By submitting reports, joining local policy networks, and attending public consultations, they can make sure the voices of those in crisis are heard at government level.\nFinally, third sector organisations should invest in staff development and digital skills. Many charities still struggle with technology and rely heavily on a small number of staff or volunteers. Training staff in digital tools, fundraising strategy, and public advocacy can make the organisation more confident and effective in any situation.\nReferences\nNCVO. (2022). Civil Society Almanac.

Many people rely on these organisations for basic needs, such as food and shelter. However, one of the biggest challenges they face is sustainability, especially when their funding depends on short-term government projects.\nTo make third sector organisations more sustainable, I believe they should focus on three key areas: diversifying income, working more flexibly, and partnering with government policymakers.\nFirst, to diversify income, charities can go beyond traditional donations and apply models like social enterprise, where they sell goods or services to fund their main goals. Many also benefit from corporate partnerships, local fundraising, grants, and even online subscriptions. For example, some food banks now partner with local grocery stores to collect regular food donations.\nSecond, these organisations should work more agilely. That means using digital tools, responding faster to local needs, and reducing red tape. For example, during the pandemic, many local charities used WhatsApp and Zoom to coordinate services quickly. Using flexible systems also helps them adapt when funding or community needs change suddenly.\nFinally, it is essential that third sector organisations have a voice in public policy. Instead of just reacting to crises, they should be part of the conversation when new social policies are being created. This can be done through research, case studies, or involving people with lived experience in meetings with government officials. Building these relationships can lead to long-term solutions, not just emergency aid.\nIf third sector organisations can build more reliable income, adapt faster, and be part of shaping policy, they will not only survive but grow stronger in the long run.\nReferences\nMacmillan, R.

Most of these organisations depend on brief projects for funding which sometimes prevents them from having a lasting effect. As a result, organizations in the third sector should increase their funding, adapt work practices and regularly engage with policy experts. A good way to increase income is to blend public money, social business, campaigns for raising funds, partnering with companies and digital giving. Crowdfunding and teaming up with supermarkets have been key to The Trussell Trust in supporting their food banks for years (The Trussell Trust, 2021). Thanks to digitalisation, charities can serve more people and raise more money. It is also very important to be agile. Hence, governmental processes should be updated by replacing strict structures with agile systems that emphasise making decisions fast, more use of technology and greater service closeness to citizens (Macmillan, 2020). The use of agile strategies helps third sector organisations respond quickly to the changing needs of their communities. Partnership with government officials helps achieve significant changes in a business. Together with service users, some organisations now work with policymakers to design new solutions to poverty and exclusion (Clark et al., 2022).\nAll in all, sustainability for the third sector over the long term is achieved when organisations have varied incomes, can adapt to changes and influence public policy through working jointly.\nSources\nClark, J., Kane, D., Wilding, K. & Bass, P.

Diversity\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.1 The business case for Diversity\n\nMaking a business case for diversity has provided justification to organisations for best practices and how it can drive progress and improve companies bottom line.  The links between diversity and financial improvement has strengthened over the last few years and organisations that have incorporated “social listening” of their employee online reviews shows the importance of inclusion and why companies should pay attention to diversity on moral grounds of fairness and equal opportunity.  However the report from Orgiane Georgea and Aneeta Rattan in June 2022, outlined why organisations should stop making the business case for diversity as they found that this approach makes underrepresented job candidates less interested to work with an organisation and it undermines Diversity and Inclusion effort.  The authors suggested that a ”fairness” case is more effective and is based on “moral grounds”.  Through their research they found that 80% of organisations used the business case to justify diversity with less than 5% using the fairness case.  They also found that:\n“Our statistically robust findings show that underrepresented participants who read a business case for diversity on average anticipated feeling 11% less sense of belonging to the company, were 16% more concerned that they would be stereotyped at the company, and were 10% more concerned that the company would view them as interchangeable with other members of their identity group, compared to those who read a fairness case.”\nUltimately the business case for diversity can have negative impacts on underrepresented groups as it can undermine diversity efforts and therefore a fairness case is more effective. \n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\nv7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\n\nReports have identified that Women and BAME communities are under-represented in full-time work and leadership roles across UK organisations who need to explore wider talent pools to draw candidates from throughout the community and understanding diverse markets and clients.  One example in 2020 was Marks and Spencer who reviewed its workforce and identified that it needed to reflect a truly diverse and inclusive environment through its employment practices, its retailing practices including ranges it carries and its store layouts and as a business with stores in the communities.  Marks and Spencer had a large population of retail assistants who were white females and they identified that they needed to more reflective to represent their diverse customer base through recruiting, retaining diverse talent through setting targets for ethnic minorities and women in management.\nAnother initiative across organisations has been to increase the number of women into executive roles at Board level.  During 2021 40% of UK FTSE 100 board positions were held by women compared with 12.5% just over 10 years ago.  (Gov.uk, 2022).  Having a diverse workforce can generate higher profits and even a 10% increase in women in organisation has been linked to 3% in increase in profits.\nThe government has introduced legislation in the form of Gender pay Gap reporting for organisations with over 250 employees who have to report annually on their gender pay gap with the aim of helping reduce the gap between what women and men are paid.  Some organisations have set targets to reduce this imbalance with a large construction company setting targets to increase the number of women they employ to earning over £40,000 a year to at least 25% by 2025.  Visit the equality and human rights act and read the Closing the Gender Pay Gap report. \nTraditionally the typical family model has been the women as care giver providing care for the children and being employed in part-time roles, allowing them to work around childcare for example with the man being the breadwinner going out to work.  Many leaders in organisations have been white strong men.  Thinking about governments we have seen only one black leader in the USA and two women prime ministers in the UK, which does not represent our diverse communities.\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n7.3 So what are the solutions?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.3 So what are the solutions?\n\nOne of the solutions is to introduce Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging Programmes.  Organisations such as the UK Supreme Court have created diversity, inclusion and belonging strategies to help them reflect the society we live in and to respect the differences and supporting equal opportunity for everyone.  This means doing the right thing and that every member of staff within the court feels they belong through contributing their views which will be valued.   \nYou can read more about their strategy as - https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/uksc-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-strategy-2021.pdfLinks to an external site. \nSome of the ways that organisations can introduce these programmes is to ensure that they attract, recruit and develop diverse talent and work with under-represented groups to retain diverse workforce.  Development of inclusive leaders is important, and organisations need to ensure these have the skills, confidence and behaviours to build positive relations that enables all employees to thrive.  Through people analytics and data collection relating to diversity will help understand and develop aspects of diversity in the workplace.  By being an employer of choice and taking action to be inclusive, supportive and respectful will ensure that employees wellbeing matters and it is a brilliant experience for all.  Finally organisations that support accessibility for all in promoting education and outreach work will promote themselves to others. \n\nTopic 7\n7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\n\nEqual opportunities legislation is generally targeted at ensuring procedural justice is promoted and it prohibits discrimination against ANYONE.  However Affirmative Action programmes on the other hand, deliberately attempt to advance groups under-represented in the workforce through redistributive, or retributive justice.\nOrganisations need to ensure that they have fair:\nRecruitment policies\njob criteria\nTraining programmes for discriminated groups\npromotion procedures to senior positions for discriminated groups\nDiscrimination as the solution to discrimination?  Positive discrimination is generally unlawful in the UK for example where an employer wants to recruit a person specifically based on their protected characteristics such as Race for example.  However the previous Met Police Chief Cressida Dick asked for the law to be changed so that their recruitment processes could favour ethnic minority candidates over white applications as currently the force does not represent the community and nearly 8000 complaints of racism have been received.  The Met Police want to recruit a diverse workforce that represents their community; however this may mean they are not selecting the best candidates and having  targets to recruit higher ethnic participation is good may mean accepting lower standards.\n\nTopic 7\n7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \n\nIndividuals are living longer than previously with life expectancy for example in the UK which has increased from about 72 in the 1960s to 81.2 years in 2019.  This means that individuals are likely to work longer and therefore organisations need to review the opportunities for the older generation.  Thinking about some job roles, how realistic that someone in their 70s can be an active firefighter or prison warden?  Therefore organisations need to think about different job roles and how individuals can manage their work and expectancy.  Individuals will be less likely to be able to retire at 65 as they may not have the required savings to provide a reasonable income and research has suggested that many individuals currently in their mid-40s may need to work into their early to mid-70s to cover this financial shortfall. \nThis image from Gratton and Scott (2017) study shows some of the changes for example historically individuals went to school, work and then retired.  However now they have multistages of life, they go to school they may work as an employee, or they may look to mix this with self-employment or even have a portfolio of work which is paid and unpaid which they may take into retirement.  Therefore organisations need to consider how they can change corporate policies and HR policies and practices to support healthy and prosperous longevity.\n\nFigure 1:  Changing Ideas of Wellbeing at/about Work (Gratton & Scott, 2017)\nThe world has changed and how we are introduced to different “generations” in society.  Generations is the sociological notion of being born across a span of about 20 years, for example:\nGen Z (zoomers) born mid to late 1990s to early 2010\nGen Y (millennials) born between 1981 and 1994/6\nGen X born between 1965 and 1981\nBaby boomers born between 1945 and 1964\nThe literature is clear, the statistical differences across most measures on common work issues/styles is so small that more research should be focusing on generational similarities and not differences.   Each of these different generations may exist at the same time and therefore how do organisations build gaps between the way they work and communicate?   Gen X tend to have values of ambition and strong ability to work hard where Gen Y are competitive in an extremely advanced world.  Gen Z grew up with tablets and smartphones and digital experiences are crucial to their DNA.  They are able to multi-task be independent and can be demanding in the workplace and if they are not engaged, they will leave.\nSo what can an employer do to improve its working practices covering these generational differences? \nEmployers need to develop wellbeing policies and procedures to ensure that employees are engaged and thrive through reduced stress, anger and health problems.  The relationship between engagement and wellbeing is vital because when people experience work influences their lives outside work and overall wellbeing influence their lives at work.\nGallup have produced a report which identified that wellbeing is crucial for business.  You can read it here:  https://www.gallup.com/workplace/313067/employees-aren-thriving-business-struggling.aspxLinks to an external site.. \nThe report was based on positive psychology, and it identified 34 themes based on the fact that the individual spends approximately 81,396 hours at work.  Organisations now report their employee engagement to customers, and they suggested that those not thriving in their lives are more vulnerable and add risk to the organisation in terms of burnout and stress.   They also identified that 52% of workers who were thriving had less missed absence and struggling employees had higher levels of depression and anxiety resulting in big differences in productivity.  The latest 2022 report identified that global engagement was still low and employee stress was at a new all-time high with over 44% of employees experiencing daily stress.  The report also identified that the best places in the world to be an employee were the US And Candidate with being the No1s for living comfortably, employee engagement, job opportunities and second for wellbeing.\nHow can organisations improve wellbeing?\nPerkbox in 2020, identified the following different ways that an organisation can improve employee wellbeing:\nProvide employee assistance programme\nHelp employees work towards long-term goals\nSet friendly fitness challenges\nIntroduce wellbeing-based employee benefits\nArrange regular get-togethers\nIntroduce designated wellbeing leaders\nEncourage real breaks\nCreate a comfortable work environment\nReward and recognise great work\nEncourage staff to take responsibility for their own wellbeing\nConsider offering unlimited holidays\nCreate stronger employee-manager relationships\nArrange wellbeing workshops\nMake it easy for your staff to make healthy choices\nTweak the working routine to work for staff\nSurvey teams to find out which of the wellbeing initiatives are working\nThinking about our own organisation which of these initiatives do they offer and how effective do you think they are?\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762188-20564-Topic_8_.docx ---\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. The business of business is business’.\n‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’.\n\nHowever, only human beings have moral responsibility for their actions; corporations aren’t human beings, despite the name and the sense of being a body.  Doing otherwise than acting for shareholders was for him a betrayal and theft from shareholders’ dividends.\nTherefore, as long as business complies with society’s laws and regulations for business, their only responsibility is to act in the best interest of shareholders and businesses aren’t elected, and managers aren’t trained to decide what’s in society’s best interests.\nFriedman was part of the Chicago School of Economics, associated with monetarist policy, reduction in public spending. Arguably, with his ideological opponent JM Keynes, the most influential economist of the 20th century.  This article is ‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’ and if you look on Canvas you can read it in full.  It was an essay published over 50 years ago in (1970) and took issue with what he saw as a distressing trend among corporations to worry about social responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.

become the widely accepted term for when companies have a “corporate internal decision structure which directs decisions in line with predetermined goals” – strategy (French 1979) and that organisations “manifest a set of beliefs and values that lay out what is generally regarded as right or wrong in the corporation”  organizational culture (Moore 1999).  There is a sense that they are entities which can have a social impact, and that therefore this should be positive as far as possible and hence CSR is a worldwide phenomenon, above all though in the US.\n‘Semantics aside, if corporations are to formulate and implement strategies in turbulent environments, theories of strategy must have concepts, such as the wide sense of stakeholder, which allows the analysis of all external forces and pressures whether they are friendly or hostile.’  Edward Freeman (1984)\n“Corporate social responsibility is concerned with the ways in which an organization exceeds the minimum obligations to stakeholders specified through regulation and corporate governance” (Johnson and Scholes, 2002, p. 247)\nIn 2008, Banerjee put forward the moral and logical case for CSR in that:\nCorporations are powerful social actors that cause social problems and produce social goods\nCorporations should think beyond making money\nCorporations should behave in an ethical manner\nCorporations should be involved with the community they operate within\nThey can not escape their responsibilities and they must pay attention to social and environmental issues.  Organisations must demonstrate a high level of integrity and transparency across their organisations and use sustainable resources for the greater good.  They should also enhance social welfare for providing community support through philanthropy and other means. \nCarroll’s CSR pyramid is a framework for explaining how and why organisations should take social responsibility and highlights four of the most important types of responsibility for organisation:\nEconomic responsibility\nLegal responsibility\nEthical responsibility\nPhilanthropic responsibility\n\nFigure 1:  Carroll’s CSR Pyramid (ResearchGate, 2022).\nEconomic responsibility is the foundation of the pyramid and structure and is fundamental to survive in business and profitability and compliance with the law are important for social responsibility through producing goods and services that society needs at a fair price with employees who do their jobs safely and fairly.\nLegal responsibility relates to compliance with the law such as minimum wage for example across both national and local regulations.  It also regulates behaving as company citizens, meeting legal obligations through supplying goods and services that meet minimum legal requirements.\nEthical responsibility relates to embracing activities in an ethical manner and consistent with society’s expectations and respecting evolving and ethical standards that are adopted by society.  It also reflects preventing infringement of ethical standards and acknowledging that business integrity and ethical behaviour go beyond compliance with laws and regulations. \nPhilanthropic responsibility relates to voluntary and discretionary activities and practices of business such as giving back to the community through volunteer work.\nIn 1991, Donna Wood identified different approaches to Corporate Social Performance in terms of:\nHaving social policies - explicit statements of company values, goals; and social targets; emission / recycling targets.\nLeading to social programs - Activities and instruments to measure achievements of social policies.\nWith measurable social impacts - Concrete changes the corporation has achieved towards its CSR policies; although it can be difficult to measure – ‘soft’, qualitative data\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/258977.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab2fdd8176c1e350c1c53247f5931f875Links to an external site.\nWe have seen in earlier lessons how the UN is supporting global change.  Through the Global Compact campaign the UN has enacted 10 ethical principles for long – term success.  The image below shows the 10 different principles:\n\nFigure 2:  UN 10 Ethical Principles - https://www.atlantica.com/web/en/sustainability/united-nations-global-compact-ungc/Links to an external site.\nThese principles are not legally binding or mandatory or enforced but reflect the way they should be working.  It has been suggested that the Global Compact is “bluewashing” which refers to the fact that few companies are actually complying with these principles.    Bluewashing is bad because consumers tend to think that companies are more ethical and socially responsible than they are as they use their membership of Global Compact as an easy way out.  Bluewashing is focussing on human rights and labour conditions and where companies are required to submit reports.  Between 2005-2013 many thousands of companies did not comply.  Companies have said they prefer voluntary codes of conduct.\nIn addition to Bluewashing there is “greenwashing”.   This means, a strategy where companies over-emphasise positive aspects of their environmental records to mask their actual performance’ (Marquis & Qian, 2013). “At the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, a group of NGOs held a Greenwash Academy Awards event to criticize companies that falsely promote themselves as environmentally responsible and to “recognize these companies for what they are: hypocrites.” (Lyon and Maxwell, 2006, p.4) \nHere are some examples of Greenwashing in action:\n‘BP Going Green’ and ‘Beyond Petroleum’…\nThis was a multi-million-dollar advertising campaigns where they were promoting commitment to alternative energy sources.\n‘Shifting from oil to energy companies’ and they suggested ‘From the Earth to the Sun, and everything in between’ and were awarded ‘Golden Paintbrush’ by Greenpeace in

social responsibility depends on whether ethical behaviour is rewarded, and/or unethical behaviour is punished or the legitimacy of the stakeholders’ claims.  This means that the leaders’ values are important, and pressures are placed on leaders to act ethically and not unethically.   For example, when stakeholders needs and goals clash, then the most powerful tend to win.\nThis is problematic because CSR a ‘northern’ / developed world phenomenon and  the ‘Ideas developed in New York, not Sao Paolo’.  This means that power and influence of customers  in developed countries is greater than workers in developing countries and the interests of customers in developed countries are  different to interests of workers in developing countries,  CSR programs directives of ‘west’ and companies’ choses CSR goals, employees have to follow. \n\nFigure 3:  Stakeholder Map\nIf there is conflict is there a business case for CSR?  Can organisations really show causation between CSR and profits?  Good corporate citizenship can be related to good financial performance in terms of brand reputation and be attractive to prospective and current employees and we have seen earlier poor examples such as Primark where poor practice impacted their brand.   \nThe image below shows how the firms’ actions and financial returns influence primary stakeholders and society:\n\nFigure 4:  Mapping the business cases\nThe dotted line at the lowest part of the image shows how a firms actions link directly to financial returns and therefore shareholders take actions to remain viable.  The positive signs show how stakeholder theory reflects on firms’ financial returns which are enhanced through actions that improve the relationship with its primary stakeholder.   The dashed line at the top represents the complicated link between firms’ actions and financial returns with society.   Therefore the better the firms’ actions to better society but does it impact financial viability? \nThis article explains this in more detail and gives some good examples as to the conflict between society and stakeholders - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0007650316660044Links to an external site.  The business Case for CSR:  A critique and an indirect path forward, Barnett, 2016.\nIt could be argued that the freedom to engage in entrepreneurial activities is in itself socially responsible and can bring many benefits to society including jobs, training and revenue for suppliers.  We have seen poor practices from companies where they have dumped waste into the oceans, or their production processes pollute the air.  Apart from affecting the local community this could also impact the employees and put them at risk, increasing absence, reducing productivity and may result in fines which will negatively impact the profits and therefore the shareholders.   In 2018, a study by McKinsey found that the top quartile of companies which promoted ethnic and cultural diversity within their executive teams were 33% more likely to lead profitable companies.  Shareholders expect return on investment and companies are looking at ways they can support the communities through offering training to young people who might not have the best education and although there are costs to the shareholders of this, in the longer term the trainees become more productive and profits increase.\nSuccessful CSR\nLego if an example of great practices when it comes to CSR and sustainability.  Lego is renowned for being one of the most reputable companies in the world and not just through helping children develop through creative play but through fostering a healthier planet.  The World Wildlife Fund Climate Savers Partners named Lego in terms of its pledge to reduce its carbon footprint.  The only toy company to be named. \nBy 2030 Lego plans to use only environmentally friendly materials to produce its core products and packaging and one way that is has done this was through shrinking the box sizes by 14% in 2013 and 2014, saving approximately 7000 tons of cardboard.  They moved away from producing the blocks using petroleum-based plastic and has committed to remove all single use plastic packing from its materials by 2025. \nIn addition it has invested $164 million into a sustainable materials centre where researchers are experimenting with different bio-based materials which Lego can implement into the production process.  This is a really good example of how businesses can be socially responsible but also result in increased the profits which almost doubled between 2012 and 2015 and have increased by mover 5 million dollars between 2016 and 2021.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.4 The End of CSR?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.4 The End of CSR?\n\nIn 2012 Peter Fleming wrote about the ‘end of corporate social responsibility’ and he argued that most CSR-related activity was motivated by profit, not principles and CSR was an ideological practice that extended exploitative and colonising agenda of the corporation.\nThe article identified that damage inflicted by global firms is systematic rather than piecemeal.  They also identified gigatrends which are likely to affect the future of humanity such climate change, energy depletion, rise of BRIC nations, the genome revolution and over-population of megactivities located in the southern hemisphere. \nFleming and Jones have argued that actually large corporations tend to act only in the interests of a small number of stakeholders (e.g., their senior managers and equity holders) and therefore lack the ability to deliver outcomes that are beneficial to society as a whole.    Therefore, it could be argued that actually CSR is not about reducing the business effects on society but more a public relations strategy designed to convince governments and employees that they can still do good and make money at the same time.  Brennan argued that CSR is a “parasite” (Brennan, on wider social movements and was really more about the response to damage caused by global corporations.  Large corporates in the past have exploited workers in developing countries and are now exploiting the situation they have caused to the economic advantage to their most powerful stakeholders.  \nCompanies such as Allbirds or Sweetgreen are companies that are building social responsibility as a cornerstone to their business rather than companies that are trying to effectuate the change.  The public today is holding business leaders to account and trust in government is in decline across the UK and USA in particular.  Millennials and Gen-Z are driving this change and exert influences on organisations through purchasing power. \nIs CSR just propaganda designed to cover up parasitic corporate behaviour?\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.5 Activity 1 – Sustainability and Responsible Business

unit and from some research, I understand that responsible business means a company should not only focus on making profit, but also think about how its actions affect people, the environment, and future generations. Sustainability is about using resources wisely so that we don’t harm the planet and can continue to live well in the future.\nMain Global and Business Issues:\nClimate change – causing floods, droughts, and extreme weather that affect farming, homes, and businesses.\nPollution – from factories, cars, and plastic waste, harming air, water, animals, and human health.\nOveruse of natural resources – such as oil, water, and forests, leading to shortages and high costs.\nInequality – some businesses pay low wages or use child labor, which creates poverty.\nWaste management – businesses producing too much waste that ends up in landfills or oceans.\nHow These Issues Started Over Time:\nIn the past, businesses focused only on profit and growth, with little care for th\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762296-20564-topic_9_.docx ---\n9.1 Social enterprise and entrepreneurs?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.1 Social enterprise & entrepreneurs?\n\nA social enterprise is an independent business which is autonomous of the state and government control and set up to help the severely disadvantaged.  For example Jamie Oliver created “fifteen” which is the name of restaurants founded by the Chef to create employment for the severely disadvantaged.\nSocial entrepreneurs are those that work to improve social issues through business whilst generating profit for shareholders.  For example, Bill Drayton is a social entrepreneur and founded Ashoka:  Innovators for the Public in 1980 which looks to find and support social entrepreneurs globally.  He set out to alter existing patterns of activity and vetting and electing social entrepreneurs with unique qualities. \nLatest figures suggest there are over 100K social enterprises in the UK and they have been set up to deal with major problems such as helping overcome child poverty, drop in wages, rising house prices, pollution levels across 40 towns and cities in the UK along with obesity. \nSocial enterprises have flourished due to the failure of existing institutions to solve them through welfare state which was designed to support full, full-time employment or through bureaucracy in terms of slow, costly and dehumanising processes.  Therefore there was a need for a new approach to solving these problems.    Social enterprises get their income mainly from trading in goods and services from fast-moving, evolving environment in comparison to charities that get their income from grants and donations and existing in a more stable and slow moving environment.,    However there are some grey areas in terms of charities as social enterprises.\nThey have characteristics that enable them to transform systems and practices through being innovative, market orientated and driven to system change.  They are good at setting a mission and strong communicators being able to tell the story that focuses on the social good of the product.  They are also visionary and alliance builders and can communicate their aims in moral terms and happy to take help from wherever they can.\nSo where does social enterprise fit it?  Have a look at this image from Clearly So, 2015.\n\nFigure 1:  Where does social enterprise fit?\n\nSocial enterprises operate using different types of business model:\nFee for Service Model:\n\nFigure 2:  Fee for Service model\nIn this model the beneficiary pays for the services for a fee eg Fair for You which is a lender offering an alternative to loan sharks.  The income comes from the interest people pay directly in exchange for the service.  Legally, a charity is the sole owner of the lending company, which can gift profits to the charity.\n\nSubsidization Model:\n\nFigure 3:  Subsidization Model\nHere, the beneficiaries get stuff cheaper or free, and consumers pay for the benefits.  For example TOMS – sells shoes. For each pair sold, another is given to someone in need.  Does a lot more too…\nOf course it may be that the trading just pays for a service to be given away, not just identical products.\n\nEmployment (Social Firm Model):\n\nFigure 4:  Employment (Social Firm Model)\nSocial firms aim to employ people from disadvantaged groups.  They trade to consumers, but people in them get work, dignity, self-respect, or training.  Harry Specters’ mission is to ‘offer confidence and hope to young people with autism by providing employment and free training, enabling them to produce great products, such as our award-winning chocolates. In doing so, we aim to be a role model for “great product, great cause” for other businesses, individuals and entrepreneurs.’\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\nv9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\n\nSome of the social enterprise goals are driven by not profit or shareholder value but through setting their own high standards.  Social enterprises have missions to support and serve social or ethical issues and needs through directly being involved in the production of services.  Social enterprises create jobs and operate by setting a standard of ethics to service the society and one of the key differences is that social enterprises are less concerned with paying owners and stakeholders but more concerned with serving their societal mission.\n\nHere are some examples of social enterprise goals:\n‘Getting something from nothing’ through un-/Under-used physical, social, financial capital or through putting them to use satisfying some unmet social need(s); and by delivering outputs more efficiently than public or private sectors.\nForming long-term relationships that develop over time by outlining how it is Not about providing a service to clients nor is it about short-term profit; but it is about Long-term social return and Inclusivity by creating a sense of membership / belonging and recognising unique, distinct / different needs of users.\nInnovation and creativity:  through design / deliver new approaches to pressing problems and combine approaches from public and private sector bodies and experimenting the ‘R&D wing of the welfare system’ by creating a portfolio of solutions to issues.\nBeing ethical in terms of Britain’s top 5 co-operatives pay more tax than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks; Pay fair wages to 2,000,000 employees; and Do the greatest good possible: 28% of Social Enterprises work in poorest communities (only 12% of SMEs)\nBe successful with more social enterprises generated a profit last year than private, Growth rate of ‘responsible’ brands nearly double that of ‘conventional’ brands; Judged as ‘fairer, more diverse, and serve customers to a higher standard’ than public / private.  Demonstrate their social impact to stakeholders which is Difficult, not impossible.\nHowever Social Enterprises have started working with large corporations to drive impact together.  Through COVID-19 and climate change the private sector has been transformed and has provided corporate leaders with the opportunity to focus on their social responsibilities.  An example of this is when COVID-19 hit and a group of 85 foundations, corporations and intermediaries came together to create the World Economic Forum’s COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs.  Through social procurement strategies the group was able to provide mutually beneficial outcomes for corporations and social enterprises.   Large organisations such as Ikea and Unilever were already adopters of souring from social enterprises and with the support of Ikea Social Entrepreneurship has published the first corporate report on social enterprises.   You can read more about this report here:  How Corporations and Social Enterprises do business together to drive impact – Available at: Acumen | Corporate ReadyLinks to an external site.\nOn of the key changes to employment practices, driven by COVID-19 has been the gig-economy.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\n\nYou were introduced to Uber and the Gig Economy in an earlier lesson but here we will develop this further in terms of how it is changing the world of work.  Uberization has been defined as “fragmented work” where workers are offered small individual pieces of work which the worker can choose to accept or not.  Typically this is offered through apps that is used by both consumers and workers as an interface with little or no intermediatory.  This can have advantages for the worker in that it provides flexibility, greater independence, variety of work and pay.  However there are also disadvantages in the fact that they are not paid benefits such as sick pay, maternity leave or career progression and sometimes find it difficult to switch off. \nFrom a business perspective there are advantages as it lowers costs and gives them flexibility to adapt to scale as workers are not locked into contracts and therefore there is less regulation.  However there are usually high turnover of workers who tend to be less qualified or reliable workers and can lead to poor public perception of the organisation.\nHowever those working in Crowd working can be through global platforms who are looking for highly skilled workers:\n\nFigure 5:  Crowd working and Gig Work\nCrowd employment is a new form of employment that still uses online platform to enable organisations or individuals to solve problems or provide services in exchange for payment eg outsourcing of tasks to pool of online workers rather than single employee.  The work is based on individual tasks rather than continuous work.  Crowd working has been replaced with the term “platform work”.\nThe platform economy has brought benefits in creating jobs but for the individual it usually means they end up working for more than one platform for poor pay resulting in poor working conditions and being unable to financially survive.    Gig work is growing at a rapid rate with the sector more than doubling in size since 2016 with more than 7.25 million workers in the UK in 2022.  Part of this is due to technology and apps to sell their labour but also Covid-19 has had a massive impact in terms of how we work.    Platform economy is eg UberEats or Glovo for example and offers workers per gig basis.  A gig worker sells their skills through a platform and are usually locally based. \nPlatform work is remote and is mainly through providing digital services such as data entry or programming on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr which acts as an auction house for human labour, where individuals bid for work.  Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in lower-wage countries and it has been suggested that the office faces a future like that of the factory floor where work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. \nSadly those that work in the gig economy are no longer protected by a legal system that was designed for a different age as they are defined by workers.  Workers have minimum wage and trade union rights protected as well as paid holiday entitlements.  Only “employees” are entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payment, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal.  Gig-economy firms assume their workers to be self-employed and fight trade union such as the Independent Workers’ Union  of GB who claim otherwise.\nIt is estimated that the number of gig workers is constantly on the increase and the figure employed in this type of work is anticipated to surpass 90 million by 2028.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to keep gig workers as part of their future workforce.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\n\nOne of the other factors influencing the changing world of work is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and how they will impact the creation of new jobs.  The image below shows how these are interrelated:\n\nFigure 6:  AI or Machine Learning (Coinsight.com)\nArtificial intelligence is a computer-based design system to think the way human intelligence does and means more than doing specific tasks like Alexa who responds to your voice.  AI has the ability to make decisions and it learns from data science to create something new.  It has been used to tackle problems such as testing drug compounds for curing cancer.   AI can be used to monitor customer tracking on websites or changing traffic patterns.  Amazon Go uses AI algorithms to create unmanned convenience stores that monitor your shopping experience and charge you automatically when you walk out the door.  For example up to 400 cameras in the store monitor your interactions to charge you appropriately. \nIn contrast machine and deep learning are algorithms which do one task really well eg analysing data over time and therefore are only as good as the data flowing through the system.  Alexa runs machine learning software where the price goes up or down based on your personal information, the email that gets filtered to your inbox or chat boxes that respond when you ask questions.\nCompanies are using deep learning models and AI to stay competitive through using behavioural biometrics or language processes to improve customer service and IT management.  Therefore, data scientists and machine learning engineers are in high demand and managers and organisation need to “manage” these AI processes similarly to how they would manage people as they are a resource.  This can also include “robots” and “robotics” which means development of a new set of skills in the workplace.  AI and machine learning are going to change the way we work but they are not likely to make human workers obsolete for an awfully long time.  Automated tasks are likely to be replaced by AI but it will also drive innovation to create many new sectors for growth resulting in more wider job creation. \nHowever a recent TUC report on AI has identified the ways that AI could lead to discrimination and is calling for urgent legal reform in this area.  One recent example is how Linkedin for example has been pushing “cleaning” adverts to women only.   The case of UberLyft in the Dutch courts held the dismissal by machine as unlawful and how under GDPR automated decision making is prohibited.  The TUC have asked for an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide a right not to be discriminated against or subject to detriment for the processing of inaccurate data or through making all those in the \"value chain” jointly liable for discriminatory AI.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.5 Modern Slavery\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.5 Modern Slavery\n\nDue to the expansion of globalization, one of the outcomes of this has resulted in modern slavery where people are forced to work through threat, or they become owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical abuse, they become dehumanized through being treated as a resource, their freedom is restrained or they are exploited through underpayment (Crane, 2013b).\nRead through the Ethics in Act 7.2 from the text book and reflect on how modern slavery is impacting employees at work.\n\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.6 The Employment Relationship\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.6 The Employment Relationship\n\nEmployees are managed by the HR department and the term Human Resource Management has subject to debate as it implies humans are the resource and usually the most costly resource within an organisation.  Employees have various rights at work such as to respect their employer which is based on a general understanding of human rights and employment law.  The employee also has duties in terms of completing the work based on their contract within wider employment laws.   For example, an employee has the right to freedom from discrimination or to privacy or to health and safety working conditions.  They have duties to comply with their contract, with the law and respect the employers property.   Many organisations have comprehensive diversity, equality and inclusion policies to promote best working practices and engage staff across the organisation.  We have seen earlier sections of this course examples from Marks and Spencer and the MET police in the UK and how they are trying to attract a more diverse workforce.  We have also looked at women in senior posts and gender pay gap reporting and this is still a problem with discrimination practices being demonstrated through the recruitment and selection process and even recent cases such as Asda have highlighted the differences in pay between women and men carrying out like work.\nEmployees are entitled to privacy and control the information about themselves.  \nThere are four types of privacy:\nPhysical – surveillance cameras in private rest areas would compromise physical privacy\nSocial – freedom to behave in our private life as we so choose – however if it brings the organisation into “disrepute” then actions could be taken\nInformational – how, when and to what extent private data about others can be released and breaches eg employees social media can be monitored by organisations if it brings the organisation into disrepute\nPsychological – controlling emotional outburst and not being forced to share private thoughts and feels eg making employees smile and appear happy in front of customers.\nDepending on the organisation and industry, some employers carry out routine health and drug testing of their employees and this has been contested as an issue of business ethics.  The problem is that employees feel that the tests are taken too often and take more information than the employer actually needs and therefore does the test do more harm than good? \nTracking of emails has been common for sometime as well as checking what the employee downloads to their PC and has resulted in dismissals where company information has been leaked or when inappropriate materials have been downloaded.\nSurveillance cameras have become significant in recent years and many offices use these to protect employees and employers and there are many examples of where employees have been caught “red” handed when committing crimes or demonstrating inappropriate behaviours across the workplace.  With Covid-19 and hybrid, home working, the use of surveillance has increased and is currently under debate.  Some of the banks have adopted “key board” tracking surveillance so they can tell when their employees are typing, some are accessing the employees webcam to see when they “move” from their seat and it could be argued this is an infringement of privacy and it is interesting to see how this will develop over the next few years and how employment law/cases will introduce controls in this area.\nHow do you think surveillance will develop in the next five years? \nHow do you feel about this level of surveillance in your home when home working and how would handle this if your employer said this was mandatory from the 1st January next year?\nMake some notes and reflect on these ethical areas of change in the workplace.\n\nTopic

challenging the gig economy can be for drivers and other workers. Many of them work under zero-hour or flexible contracts, which give them freedom but don’t offer proper protections like sick pay, holiday pay, or job security. This creates a situation where workers have high risks but fewer rights.\nFor example, in the UK, Uber drivers have gone on strike several times over low pay, poor working conditions, and lack of rights. One important event was the UK Supreme Court ruling that Uber drivers should be treated as workers, not just self-employed, giving them access to basic rights. Also, the deal between Uber and the GMB union was a big step toward improving representation for drivers, allowing them to raise concerns and negotiate better conditions.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nOffer Minimum Protections: Even if workers are on flexible contracts, employers should give basic benefits like minimum wage, sick leave, and holiday pay.\nClear Contracts: Companies should give workers clear information about their rights, responsibilities, and how their pay is calculated.\nAllow Union Support: Like the Uber-GMB deal, gig workers should have access to unions or worker groups to protect their rights and raise their voices.\nUse Technology Fairly: Companies that use apps to manage workers (like Uber) must ensure the systems are fair, transparent, and not exploitative.\nListen to Workers: Regular feedback and communication with workers can help identify problems and improve working conditions.\nConclusion: The gig economy is growing, but companies must find a balance between flexibility and fairness. Giving workers more rights and protections doesn’t just help them—it also improves company reputation and worker satisfaction in the long run.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:08| Last reply 30 May 8:57\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the articles, it’s clear that Uber’s business model has come under a lot of pressure due to how it treats its drivers. The strikes, pay disputes, and legal challenges show that gig workers often face unstable incomes and limited rights. While Uber has made some progress—like its agreement with the GMB union to give 70,000 drivers minimum wage, holiday pay, and pensions—there’s still more to be done.\nIn the gig economy, many workers are classed as self-employed, which means they miss out on basic protections. To change this, employers should move toward offering more secure contracts that include benefits like sick pay, regular working hours, and protection against unfair dismissal. They should also be more open to working with unions, like GMB, and give workers a voice in decision-making. Fair algorithms and transparent policies on pay and work allocation are also key.\nUltimately, gig work can offer flexibility, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of basic rights. Companies need to take more responsibility for the people powering their platforms.\nTo improve the situation:\nGive workers fair contracts\nOffer sick pay and holiday pay\nBe clear about how pay is decided\nUse fair systems to give out work\nListen to workers and work with unions\nMake sure workers have legal rights\nExpand discussion thread from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf AlmheiriReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n26 May 23:28| Last reply 30 May 8:57\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nAfter reading the articles, it’s clear that Uber has had a complicated relationship with its drivers in the UK. The gig economy has brought a lot of flexibility to workers, but it also comes with big downsides especially when it comes to job security, pay, and basic rights.\nIn the Bloomberg article, we see concerns over a fuel shortage and a possible union strike, which shows just how fragile the situation can be for gig workers. The Employee Benefits article highlights that drivers are striking over pay, showing that many of them don’t feel fairly treated. But there are also signs of progress. The GMB Union deal article shows that 70,000 Uber drivers in the UK now have union representation, which is a huge step forward. And the Supreme Court ruling confirms that Uber drivers are workers not independent contractors which means they’re entitled to benefits like minimum wage and holiday pay.\nThese developments show that employers can make changes when there’s enough pressure from workers, the public, or legal systems.\nTo improve the situation, companies in the gig economy should:\n•Offer clearer contracts that reflect the reality of the work and provide fair terms.\n•Guarantee a minimum wage, so workers know they’ll earn enough to live on.\n•Provide benefits like sick pay, holiday pay, and pension contributions.\n•Allow union representation so workers have a voice.\n•Be transparent about how pay is calculated and how decisions are made (like deactivations).\nUltimately, flexibility shouldn’t come at the cost of fairness. Gig economy companies can still be profitable while treating their workers with dignity and respect.\nExpand discussion thread from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al AhbabiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nHatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n23 May 17:36| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nReply from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nThe case of Uber in the UK highlights the growing debate around how companies in the gig economy treat their workers. While platforms like Uber have created jobs for many, they have also raised concerns about job security, pay fairness, and workers’ rights.\nFrom the articles, one of the biggest turning points was the UK Supreme Court’s decision in 2021 that Uber drivers should be classified as “workers” rather than independent contractors (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This gave them legal rights to minimum wage and holiday pay, which was a big win for gig workers in the UK.\nLater, Uber made a historic agreement with GMB Union, giving about 70,000 drivers in the UK the right to union representation (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). While this was praised by many, the situation remains tense. Uber drivers have continued to strike, arguing that pay levels are still too low and conditions are not fully fair (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.).\nThese events show that legal victories alone are not enough — real change needs to happen in the way gig workers are treated daily.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve Gig Work Conditions:\nRedefine What “Gig Work” Means: Employers should stop hiding behind the label of “self-employed” just to avoid giving benefits. If the company controls working hours, pricing, and performance like Uber does then the worker should have rights just like an employee.\nCreate Fair Pay Standards: Gig companies should provide a clear minimum pay guarantee per hour, including waiting time. Drivers often spend time online without rides, which affects their real earnings.\nGive Gig Workers a Voice: Companies should regularly meet with driver representatives and unions to discuss policies and pay. Uber’s deal with GMB was a strong start, but more engagement is needed to fix ongoing disputes.\nBuild Flexibility with Protection: Flexibility is one reason why people join the gig economy  but it should not come at the cost of basic protections. Employers should offer opt-in insurance, sick pay schemes, and support services.\nInvest in Worker Wellbeing: Companies like Uber depend on their drivers, but often offer little support during crises like fuel shortages or pandemics. Offering fuel discounts, mental health resources, and fair cancellation policies can build trust and reduce worker stress.\nConclusion\nThe Uber case shows that responsibility and flexibility can go together. While the company has taken some steps to support its drivers, the ongoing strikes and dissatisfaction suggest that more honest, fair, and balanced systems are needed. The gig economy will only be sustainable if workers are treated as essential partners not disposable service providers.\nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n23 May 17:34| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nAfter reading the articles about Uber and its drivers in the UK, it’s clear that the gig economy has created a lot of flexibility — but also many challenges for workers. Drivers often work long hours without stable income, benefits, or job security. The Uber case is a great example of how limited protection through self-employment contracts has raised serious concerns.\nIn the past, Uber classified its drivers as independent contractors. This meant they had no access to minimum wage, holiday pay, sick leave, or pensions. The situation reached a turning point when the UK Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that Uber drivers should be treated as \"workers\", not just self-employed freelancers (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This decision was historic because it forced Uber to rethink its contracts and give drivers more legal protection.\nSince then, Uber signed a union agreement with GMB, giving 70,000 UK drivers access to representation, which was a big step forward (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). Still, challenges remain. According to recent reports, drivers have gone on strike over pay and working conditions, especially during the UK fuel crisis (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.). Many feel the changes haven’t gone far enough.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nFair Contracts: Employers like Uber should move away from using zero-hour or purely self-employed contracts for core roles. If workers rely on the job for regular income, they should receive protections like minimum wage and sick leave.\nWorker Representation: Giving gig workers access to independent unions and allowing them to raise issues safely is essential. Uber’s agreement with GMB is a positive example, but more companies need to follow this model.\nTransparent Pay and Conditions: Companies should clearly explain how drivers or gig workers are paid, including how rates are set and what deductions apply. Hidden fees and unclear commissions create stress and reduce trust.\nSupport for Health and Wellbeing: Gig workers often work long hours with few breaks. Employers can offer support like insurance, access to counselling, or even discounts on fuel and maintenance.\nTechnology Transparency: Many drivers rely on apps to get work, but these systems often control how much they earn or whether they stay on the platform. Workers should have more input into how these systems work and appeal unfair deactivations.\nConclusion:\nThe Uber case shows that change is possible when workers stand up and the law supports them. But more still needs to be done to make the gig economy fair and sustainable. Employers need to take responsibility — not just for profits, but for the people who power their platforms.\nReferences\nADCU. (2021). Supreme Court Landmark Victory Over Uber.

The clashes Uber has faced in the UK highlight the rising disagreements between new technology and workers’ legal rights. By calling Uber drivers employees, the 2021 decision by the UK Supreme Court redefined what employers must and should provide (Supreme Court, 2021). Employers have many solutions they can implement. Formulating rules that protect the hours worked, benefits received and end of employment can give workers a foundation of dignity in the workplace (ILO, 2021). Let’s also ensure that both workers and management work together for solutions. Whilst that agreement shows progress, Uber should now let drivers contribute to pay discussions and work environment (GMB, 2022). Also, websites must work on becoming more transparent. It is important that everyone can review the algorithms that distribute jobs and salaries, to prevent being exploited. In addition, governments and businesses should together establish rules that list platform workers in different categories with suitable perks. The most ethical approach is for people to have the flexibility they want while still earning fair wages. Following this, companies should rewrite their contracts, help workers unify and put people’s wellbeing first.\nReferences\nGMB. (2022). Uber and GMB Strike Historic Deal.

Pandemic > 10.2 Ethical procurement or corporate gravy train?\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying and the giving of contracts during COVID-19 in an early lesson, however during the pandemic the UK government spent £56m on private consultants during the pandemic, at rates of up to £14,000 per day, without giving other companies a chance to compete. \nSixteen private consultancy firms, including major companies like Deloitte, PWC, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey have been working at the heart of the government’s response to the virus and it is suggested that they have made deals with Tory party donors/members worth up to £526 m: P14 Medical; Meller Designs; Globus (Shetland)  They have been rapidly hired to work on the track and trace system, the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the search to produce working ventilators.\nAmong the contracts given to McKinsey, whose consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks’ work – £14,000 a day - to createLinks to an external site. a permanent replacement for Public Health England, helping define its “vision, purpose and narrative”.\nThere is discussion of a close relationship which centred around horse racing between Dido Harding and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, where P14 medical had ten employees and is owned by a Tory Councillor.  Meller’s owner gave £60k to party, Shetland has given £400k for special access to PM etc. as part of the ‘Leader’s Group’. \nAlso, the National Audit Office has carried out a review in terms of regarding the contracting of PPE during the crisis, which was apparently agreed without going through the official process. \nDuring the pandemic, AHRC-funded research has studied questions relating to legal and ethical perspectives and responsiveness within health and social care in the government.  These studies have related to COVID--19 related fraud, public sector procurement and use of management of data by the public sector such as through vaccine development, uptake and delivery.   The University of Bristol have completed a specific study focusing on fraud during the pandemic and whether the rules for criminalizing fraud is fit for purpose.  The research highlighted the need for reform of current practices and that prosecutorial guidance needed to be produced to minimize the role of conspiracy to defraud.  Overall, there needs to be greater transparency in terms of data relating to conspiracy to defraud with suggestions that publication of disaggregated charging figures be used. \nThere are a lot of lessons to be learned from the pandemic in terms of tightening up the governance in organisations to improve processes and business continuity plans through supply chains and sourcing strategies which are redesigned to focus on resilience rather than focusing on lowest price. \nIs this just an amplification of the existing cosy relationship between governments of whatever party, and corporates?\n\nTopic

street is in decline due to the increase in online shopping resulting in a loss of jobs and has created more precarious work for gig economy workers.  Also private landlords have continued to benefit due to contracts to ensure no evictions resulting in a gap between wealthier professionals and those who have to work face to face.    Following COVID-19 and the removal of all restrictions some employers are forcing their workers back to the office which is resulting in the great resignation which reflects how employees are reviewing their work life balance and looking for employees that can offer fully home working or hybrid working.  This is a good article to read which relates to CSR and COVID-19:  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joms.12642Links to an external site..\nFollowing COVID, it has been identified that organisations need to be able to react more rapidly and be more agile and responsive to the needs of policy makers and citizens.   One of the most urgent needs is to build a persuasive knowledge society which is informed by integrated and trustworthy science to develop the knowledge to respond to today’s challenges.  However access to knowledge creation and dissemination needs to be equitable to leading to the three pillars of sustainable development reviewed in an earlier week.  The world we live in needs to be more interconnected and there needs to be solutions designed through open and inclusive sciences through the support of all governments.  International collaboration, engaging with knowledge partners and fostering networks of mutual learning can help problem solve across the world.\nThere is suggestion of a need for more public and private partnerships to engage in the sustainability agenda to enable this rapid response and throughout COVID-19 the private sector contributed most to research activities and were able to share data or make their technology platforms available for track and trace for example.\nOne of the key trends following COVID-19 is how organisations adapt to the new world through for example home/hybrid working.  Some organisations have closed their large offices in large cities in the UK and have moved to fully remove working or a hybrid model with hot desking and employees coming into smaller shared spaces at least once a week.  Flexible working and home working has intensified throughout the pandemic, and it now remains should be return to onsite work?  With organisations that have 100% productivity what is the need to go back to their offices and how will this make it better?  Some employees have refused to return to the workplace, and this is something organisations need to consider.  Organisations need to consider a portfolio-based approach to work in terms of using multiple options such as automation, gig talent, alliances and through outsourcing activities.  Organisations will need to restructure, and they will need to ensure that their employees have the right skills to defuse risk, optimise costs and develop needed capabilities.  Companies that will thrive post COVID will be those that have the right mix of flexibility and resilience.\nMatt Symonds, one of the Co-founders of Fortuna Admissions has suggested there are seven ways to make business truly sustainable post COVID.\nSeven Ways to Make Business Truly Sustainable Post-COVID (forbes.com)Links to an external site.\nThese are:\nFlattening the curve – in terms of for example, demand for health care systems or through the demand for utilities through managing interrelated systems and AI to help individuals respond to market conditions\nEngage with the local community at a grass roots level – going beyond emissions for example and really working with diverse communities through organisations seeing local community as their partners in achieving human security, sustainability and resilience.\nRealise the global impact of your actions – rethink production, trade and consumption models in sufficiency instead of continued growth\nEmpower employees to make them happier and more productive – changes to management thinking and trust to make people happy and productive through remove working by empowering employees. Organisations need to develop trusting relationships characterised by supportive leadership, mutual support and shared commitment.\nDon’t “go it alone” to solve difficult problems – the pandemic has shown that organisations need to pool together their resources to find ways to tackle major challenges and therefore collaboration bring together inter-disciplinary experts who have insight to identify solutions. Having inclusive and productive culture which is underpinned by revised reward systems and promotion partners leads to embedded partnerships.\nDon’t make profit your sole priority – organisations should act responsibly by paying their taxes as opposed to trying to avoid these (as seen in earlier lessons. Organisations that have a “just in time” operational practices and associate this with their financial strategies links to the profit maximizing thing to do. \nEmbrace “green capitalism” – should we revisit the model of capitalism as COVID has shown how shareholder capitalism in the form of cooperative with stakeholders and shareholders is good business.\nHow effective do you think these practices will be post COVID and are there any other practices that you think organisations should consider in the future?\nPost COVID Supply Chain Sustainability Trends\nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis we have seen vulnerabilities to the supply chain and therefore transformational change needs to take place so that in future supply chains are not as significantly affected and trade can still happen.\nOne of the ways this can happen is through increased supply chain transparency.  Due to lockdowns and reduced working, global supply chains were damaged throughout COVID-19 and organisations need to review the resilience of these in future to increase business sustainability.  One of the ways this can happen is through increased technology and digital maps (or digital twins) of their supply chains.  Digital maps contain all the relevant information on an organisation’s suppliers, their sites, any products at risk and enables them to conduct scenario analysis to inform contingency plans.   These maps will help organisations make vital decisions without having to scramble for unorganised data or rely on one or two suppliers during times of change. \nThe Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures provides recommendations on how organisations can assess their own risks and present opportunities for improvements through climate change through innovation of new products and services to create wider range of procurement channels that mitigate risk and drive supplier competition.\nOne of the key trends following COVID is the importance of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in terms of people from vulnerable communities and how they are being exploited through environmental practices.  Organisations need to review their supply chains to make sure they are inclusive and sustainable to move society forwards.\nOrganisations need to consider the reduction with suppliers they have direct as well as indirect contact with.  Most organisations deal with suppliers who then deal with other suppliers in the chain.  The organisation may use the supplier for their ethical and sustainable practices, but how does it view the practices of those two or three layers into the supply chain that they have no direct contact with?  This is interesting and something organisations need to consider in the future.  They may have no contractual relationship with these lower suppliers, but their ethical practices may impact and influence their ethical and sustainability polices. \nOrganisations need to revisit the social agenda and the disadvantaged and marginalised across the communities and what they need to do to drive diversity, inclusion and fairer human rights through meeting the needs of various stakeholders.  Technology is advancing at such a range that it is increasing the privacy and human rights agenda as we have seen in previous weeks of this unit.  There is growing importance for organisation to align new technologies with human right principles.  Organisations need to consider their “executive compensation” packages for retiring or removal of executives.  The community are conscious of these unfair practices and it is clear that large payoffs for corrupt senior executives is no longer ethical or good sustainable business practice.\nHealth and wellbeing are growing areas for organisations through the pandemic but also for organisations to focus more on the long-term physical goals of their employees.  Organisations are investing in programmes such as meditation, yoga and relaxation classes or supporting employees through paid gym membership fees as they have identified that investing in the long-term health of their employees provides benefits to the organisation through better customer services and employee engagement and productivity.\n\nTopic 10\nPrevious\nNext\n10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 10 – Business Ethics in the Pandemic > 10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\n\nDiscussion Activity -

Environment/Sustainability\nPositive Effects: During lockdowns, air and water pollution levels dropped due to reduced travel and industrial activity. For example, cities experienced clearer skies and cleaner rivers.\nNegative Effects: These improvements were temporary. As activities resumed, pollution levels rebounded. Additionally, the pandemic led to a surge in medical waste, like disposable masks and gloves, which increased environmental pollution.\nConclusion: The pandemic showed that environmental improvements are possible but require sustained efforts beyond temporary shutdowns.\n2. Globalisation\nDisruptions: COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages of goods and highlighting the risks of over-reliance on international trade.\nShifts: Some countries began focusing more on local production and reducing dependence on global suppliers.\nConclusion: While globalisation faced challenges, it adapted rather than reversed. The pandemic emphasized the need for more resilient and diversified supply chains.\n3. Stakeholders\nCommunication Changes: With restrictions on gatherings, businesses and organizations shifted to online platforms to engage with stakeholders.\nChallenges: Virtual interactions couldn't fully replace the benefits of in-person meetings, leading to difficulties in building trust and collaboration.\nConclusion: The pandemic accelerated digital engagement but also highlighted the importance of personal connections in stakeholder relationships.\n4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nIncreased Focus: Companies placed greater emphasis on CSR, supporting communities through donations, adapting operations to produce essential goods, and ensuring employee well-being.\nStrategic Integration: CSR became more integrated into core business strategies, reflecting a shift towards long-term sustainability and social responsibility.\nConclusion: The pandemic reinforced the importance of CSR, showing that ethical practices can align with business success.\n5. Third Sector (Charities and Nonprofits)\nAdaptation: Many organizations quickly adapted by moving services online and finding new ways to support communities.\nFinancial Strain: Despite increased demand for services, many faced funding challenges due to economic downturns.\nConclusion: The third sector demonstrated resilience and innovation but requires ongoing support to sustain its vital role in society.\nOverall Reflection: The impacts of COVID-19 confirm many theoretical approaches discussed in the module. They highlight the interconnectedness of global systems, the importance of sustainable practices, and the need for ethical responsibility across all sectors. These insights will be valuable for the upcoming assignment.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:29| Last edited 29 May 6:30| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nEnvironment:\nCOVID caused a short drop in emissions.\nIt showed the need for greener, long-term practices.\nImpact: Boost in eco-friendly tech and digital supply chains.\nExample: DHL used digital mapping to cut emissions and improve delivery efficiency.\nGlobalisation:\nThe pandemic disrupted global supply chains.\nCompanies are now going more local and flexible.\nImpact: Less reliance on overseas suppliers.\nExample: UK supermarkets sourced more local produce due to import delays.\nStakeholders:\nMany workers faced health risks and poor treatment.\nTrust in employers dropped during the crisis.\nImpact: More focus on employee safety and rights.\nExample: Amazon workers protested over unsafe working conditions.\nCSR:\nSome companies helped, others acted selfishly.\nCSR was tested during the pandemic.\nImpact: Increased pressure for genuine, people-first actions.\nExample: Pret offered NHS workers free drinks and discounts.\nThird Sector:\nCharities faced more demand but limited funding.\nShort-term support wasn’t enough.\nImpact: Need for long-term partnerships and stability.\nExample: UK food banks saw usage soar while struggling to meet needs.\nConclusion:\nCOVID revealed ethical and operational weaknesses.\nIt confirmed the need for responsible, fair business.\nImpact: Push for sustainability, fairness, and stakeholder trust.\nExample: Many businesses now include well-being in their long-term goals.\nExpand discussion thread from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf AlmheiriReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAbdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n23 May 12:19| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\nReply from Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n \nEnvironment & Sustainability\nImpact:\nTemporary environmental improvements during lockdowns (e.g. reduced air pollution).\nRise in plastic and medical waste post-pandemic.\nTheory: Confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve – economic shifts affect environmental outcomes.\nExample: Global drop in emissions during 2020, followed by rebound due to recovery activities\n Globalisation\nImpact:\nDisrupted global supply chains led to regionalisation.\nEmphasis on supply chain resilience and local sourcing.\nTheory: Supports “glocalization” – global framework with local execution.\nExample: Firms reshoring manufacturing to reduce dependency\nStakeholders\nImpact:\nShift to digital stakeholder engagement; highlighted the digital divide.\nTheory: Partially challenges Stakeholder Theory – virtual tools aren’t always inclusive.\nExample: Limited access in remote areas affected community involvement\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nImpact:\nCompanies with strong CSR showed higher resilience.\nCSR efforts expanded to include public health and community aid.\nTheory: Supports Business Case for CSR – social responsibility strengthens long-term success.\nExample: CSR-linked firms had better stock performance.\nReference: ScienceDirect (2024)\n\nThird Sector (NGOs/Nonprofits)\nImpact:\nFaced funding cuts, but adapted with innovation and digital solutions.\nTheory: Confirms Resource Dependence Theory – success depends on adaptability.\nExample: Virtual fundraising and partnerships increased\n \nReferences ;\nScienceDirect (2024).

I examined the correlation between each point and theoretical frameworks, as well as whether actual occurrences corroborate or contest such concepts.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nLockdowns resulted in diminished pollutant levels owing to decreased transportation and industrial operations. Conversely, plastic waste has grown due to masks, takeout packaging, and medical supplies. Additionally, several enterprises postponed their sustainability objectives owing to fiscal pressures.\nExample: In 2020, cities like as London had improved air quality during lockdowns, although encountered increased waste from personal protective equipment (PPE).\nTheory: This somewhat undermines sustainability theory, which anticipates long-term advancement. The COVID-19 pandemic shown that advancements might be impeded during crises.\nGlobalisation\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the interconnectedness of the global community. When one nation ceased operations, others were impacted as well. Supply networks were disrupted, trade diminished, and travel ceased. Numerous enterprises began seeking local suppliers to mitigate potential hazards.\nExample: UK supermarkets saw shortages due to the inability of international suppliers to deliver.\nTheory: This validates globalization theory, demonstrating that international commerce amplifies risks during global crises.\nStakeholders\nThe outbreak affected employees, consumers, vendors, and local communities. Some corporations stressed employee wellness, while others focused only on simple survival. Employee welfare and job security surfaced as prominent issues.\nExample: Companies like Morrisons offered monetary incentives to employees, whilst others enacted layoffs.\nTheory: This validates stakeholder theory, which posits that corporations must consider all stakeholders, not alone profit.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nMany companies escalated their initiatives during the crisis. They allocated funds, aided critical personnel, or endorsed the NHS. Some employed their resources to aid the public instead of only selling products.\nExample: McDonald’s provided complimentary lunches to NHS personnel, while BrewDog manufactured hand sanitizers.\nTheory: This substantiates CSR theory, demonstrating that ethical behavior is crucial, particularly during a crisis.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-Profits)\nCharities had considerable difficulties during the COVID-19 epidemic. Events were canceled and contributions decreased. Concurrently, a growing population requires support with nutrition, shelter, and mental health.\nExample: The Trussell Trust, a food bank organization, experienced a significant increase in individuals need food assistance.\nTheory: This undermines the notion that the third sector can consistently bridge the gap; they require additional support and investment during crises.\nFinal Notes for Assignment: COVID-19 confirmed many theories about business responsibility and ethics, but it also showed weaknesses, especially in sustainability and the third sector. These notes will help me explain how theory meets real life in my assignment.\n \n \nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n19 May 13:10| Last reply 23 May 9:26\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Business and Society\nI learned a lot from the courses and my own study. I realized that COVID-19 had a huge influence on many parts of business and society. Here are the effects I've found, along with real-life examples and how they fit with theory.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nThe situation got better in certain aspects at the start of COVID-19. There were fewer automobiles and flights, which meant less pollution in the air. But as time went on, more trash was made, mostly from masks, gloves, and take-out boxes. A lot of businesses also put their aspirations to go green on hold so they could focus on staying alive.\nThis goes against sustainability philosophy since it indicates that when circumstances are tough, environmental ideals aren't always the most important thing.\nGlobalisation\nThe epidemic made it very hard for trade to happen over the world. Because to manufacturing and border closures, a lot of firms couldn't receive the goods they needed. Ford and Toyota, for example, had to cease making cars because they didn't have enough parts. To reduce future danger, several businesses are increasingly choosing local suppliers.\nThis backs up the thesis of globalization by showing how interrelated countries are and how a problem in one location may affect the whole world.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 had an effect on workers, consumers, suppliers, and communities. A lot of people lost their employment or had to work from home. Health and safety were more essential. Some companies did a good job of taking care of their employees (such Tesco awarding bonuses), while others were criticized for not doing enough.\nThis backs up stakeholder theory, which claims that businesses should care for all of their stakeholders, not just their shareholders.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nA lot of businesses started doing more to aid the neighborhood. BrewDog, for instance, provided hand sanitizer, and grocery stores opened early for NHS personnel and seniors. During the crisis, some businesses really cared.\nThis backs up CSR theory by showing that companies can be responsible, even when things are rough.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-profits)\nDuring the epidemic, it was challenging for charities. There were fewer donations and events were canceled. But people wanted their aid more. Food banks like The Trussell Trust, for instance, witnessed a huge rise in the number of individuals who needed help.\nThis goes against some ideas in the third sector since it revealed how hard it is for charities to get by when they don't have enough money.\nConclusion\nThe pandemic showed that business is not just about profit. It confirmed that companies have responsibilities to the environment, people, and society. At the same time, it also showed that in a crisis, some of these responsibilities can be pushed aside. These insights help me better understand how theory applies to real-world situations.\nExpand discussion thread from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n19 May 0:35| Last reply 19 May 8:41\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nAlyazia Ayed Al Ahbabi\nID: 2447614\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Key Areas\n1.

However, these gains were temporary; Less than two years after the pandemic began, emissions had returned to the levels seen before the outbreak, solidifying Blowfield’s (2013) view that many programs for environmental sustainability address surface-level issues without fundamentally transforming systems. The pandemic also paused corporate climate action, exposing a tension between environmental ambition and short-term financial survival. This challenges the optimistic premise in Carroll's Corporate Social Performance model that sustainability is always included in strategic planning. As argued by Blowfield, it confirms the requirement for transformational, as opposed to incremental change.\nGlobalization\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed how vulnerable the world’s supply networks have become, causing major shortages of essential goods. Griffin argued that rising levels of globalization significantly enhance systemic risk, which came to light during the pandemic. Many major companies reassessed the way they source and manufacture goods, prioritizing local and regional production. This question, the ‘globalization at all costs’ perspective emphasized in earlier CSR and stakeholder theories, encourages a risk-sensitive and resilient approach to globalization. Carroll's view that business corporations operate in a tightly linked global stakeholder ecosystem continues to hold, but COVID-19 illustrates that excessive reliance on global interdependence undermines resilience.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 has rewritten stakeholder priorities. Employees' health and well-being were on the radar, highlighting companies' social responsibility beyond profit margins. Amazon was beset by global protests against unsafe working conditions at warehouses, while Microsoft and Salesforce enhanced remote work benefits and mental health support. This confirms the relevance of Stakeholder Theory (Freeman, as cited in Carroll, 2023) that asserts businesses must consider a wide array of stakeholder interests. But it also challenges companies that only gave lip service to stakeholder care before the pandemic. Griffin (2014) states that crises test reputation credibility; in the case of COVID-19, companies that addressed issues honestly with stakeholders kept trust, but others lost their reputations.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nThe pandemic then proved to be a litmus test for genuine CSR. A few organizations shifted gear to purpose-driven action, Unilever handed out complimentary hygiene items, while LVMH converted perfume factories into hand sanitizer production. Such action underlines Carroll's (2023) CSR Pyramid, demonstrating that companies are able to uphold ethical and philanthropic responsibilities even amidst crisis. Yet, other firms reduced CSR spending or applied CSR as publicity, validating Crane's (2016) fear that CSR is symbolic instead of strategic. COVID-19 thus both proved and experimented with theoretical foundations, depending on whether CSR was deeply ingrained or more performative.\nThird Sector\nThe third sector experienced both pressure and visibility. Charity and NGO demand, especially for vaccination outreach, mental health, and food banks, soared. However, funding decreased as governments and donors reallocated resources. This confirms Carroll's and Crane's contention that the third sector is a necessary partner in system-level crises. It also confirms Blowfield's contention that cross-sector working is the solution to sustainable change. However, the pandemic also revealed the weakness of those third-sector organizations that lacked any digital infrastructure or scalable support systems, highlighting a need for capacity-building.\nConclusion\nOverall, COVID-19 strengthened and challenged the strengths and vulnerabilities of current sustainability, CSR, and stakeholder theory. It strengthened such theories as frameworks that are based on ethical leadership, stakeholder interaction, and systemic resilience, but challenged models that were too globalized or superficial. Next-generation business models will be required to evolve accordingly, both theoretically and practically.\n \nSources\nBlowfield, M. (2013). Business and sustainability.

You can read more at:  Responsible Business in a post COVID-19 world | Deloitte SwitzerlandLinks to an external site.\nOne way to do this is through ethical supply chains such as ensuring eradication of child labour, ensuring safe and hygienic working conditions, ensuring employees are paid fairly for the hours worked, ensuring humane and non-discriminatory treatment, demonstrating environmental awareness and removing anti-bribery.\nTesco is an example of an organisation who use multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing.  For example they have an Action, Collaboration and Transformation group that ensures that those that make their garments achieve the living wage through collective bargaining and freedom of association.  They also engage with the Better Cotton Initiative which looks to improve cotton farming practices to bring economic, social and environmental benefits.  Tesco engage in over 30 different initiatives and you can read more about these here:  https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/documents/policies/tesco-and-multi-stakeholder-initiatives-for-responsible-sourcing/Links to an external site.\nConsidering these different factors, who is accountable for responsible business practices?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.2 Responsible Leadership\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.2 Responsible Leadership\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way organisations are lead and in 2020 business leaders had to respond to the crisis at pace with no previous experience to draw on.  They had to balance the safety of their front-line workers with need to enable staff to work from home.  Technology has enabled leaders to be more visible in organisations with some holding weekly company updates which would not have happened pre-COVID.  Also leaders are exposed to some of the social problems such as Black Lives Matter and have to consider how these impact their workforces.  Leaders have had to become more considerate to a wider range of stakeholder needs during the COVID years and have had to make value based and purpose drive decisions during this difficult time.  Leaders have had to create sustained social impact due to mental health and wellbeing responses to the pandemic with some employees refusing to attend the workplace.  They have had to demonstrate caring relationships with customers, employees, families and colleagues along with shareholders and front-line workers. \nAs outlined by CIPD in 2022, responsible leadership has three different levels which became apparent during the pandemic:\nIndividual: the personal integrity of leaders was a critical factor during COVID-19, with leaders under intense pressure. Many talked about needing to fall back onto their personal sense of right and wrong. They spoke of a new-found humility, born out of having to learn to listen to others. \nOrganisational: in terms of role-modelling a response, many felt liberated. People also spoke of ‘taking off their armour’, implying that pre-COVID-19, they were operating in an organisational system that stifled their personal sense of right and wrong. \nSocietal: leaders were heavily engaged with health services and government, trying to ascertain what their organisations could do to help society. Communicating far more with the outside world, albeit virtually, they were in the company of like-minded leaders, sharing a common purpose.  (CIPD, 2022)\nThe pandemic has changed the way we live and work and there is impatience about the pace of change particularly when change was very fast during the pandemic.  Society wants greater justice and fairness through pay rewards and we are seeing various organisations in 2022 starting to strike over pay and conditions.  Organisations are becoming flatter with empathy and accessibility to senior teams which was not seen pre-COVID.  Rana Foroohar reported that if the rich don’t give a bit more today, they may have to give a lot more tomorrow.’ (2022) Financial Times.\nWatch this YouTube video which redefines responsible leadership from Accenture World: 5 Elements of Responsible Leadership | AccentureLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about their comments in terms of responsible leadership?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.3 What now?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.3 What now?\n\nThroughout the lessons you have seen poor practices where COVID loans have been abused by fraudsters and how senior politicians helped their friends with business contacts.  Test and trace used huge amounts of money with the better off being able to avoid financial costs of self-isolation through being able to work at home.  Wage inequality is rising in the UK and fewer are working because of long-COVID and delays to NHS treatment. \nThe ex-conservative government have been accused of “partygate” through not following COVID-19 regulations against individuals who have faced severe suffering through eg loss of loved ones and not being able to attend funerals.  This has resulted in the UK population becoming disillusioned with government and the resignation of Boris Johnson.\nCOVID has changed our lives and people are eager to travel for leisure but hybrid working has had significant impact on public transport and the city economics as people are not travelling to work.   Even though employers are making staff attend the workplace, remote working is here to stay with 25% of all professional jobs in North America being removed by the end of 2022 and this is set to increase.  This home working environment provides many benefits in terms of physical and mental well-being and large companies such as Goldman Sachs have retreated and offering working from home policies.  However we are living through transformation with automation and AI which is changing the skills that organisations are looking for.\n\nDeliotte in their “Workforce of the Future 2030” report have suggested there will be four worlds of work:\nRed – incubator for innovation racing to give consumers what they want, using digital platforms to enable those with winning ideas to be successful, where ideas rule innovation and outpaces regulation with high risks\nBlue – the corporate is king where bigger is better and where organisation size and influence is the best way to protect their profit margins against intense competition and they grow at such a scale and exert influence to become more powerful and larger than national economies\nGreen – corporate social responsibility is business imperative and organisations are characterised by social conscience, sense of environmental responsibility and they focus on diversity, human rights and trust is the basic currency underpinning business and employment\nYellow – humans come first with social-first and community businesses finding the greatest success to prosper. Crowdfunded capital flows towards ethical and blameless brands where organisations have social heart and where humanness is highlight valued.\nWhy not read more from this report

transformation and defining their own ambition level for each of the action fields in their sustainability strategy.  They will need to consider whether they will focus on a certain area or wider range of sustainability measures to remain competitive.   Organisations that fail to make these changes and address sustainability are likely to pose risks to their own business in terms of reputational damage, environmental risks and supply chain risks.  Organisations must make sustainability their guiding principles to boost energy efficiency through increased levels of recycling or rethinking their business model to discover new market potential. \nThe UK government has a 25 year sustainability plan which mainly focuses on environmental effects such as lowering carbon footprint, minimising waste and enhancing biodiversity on their sites.  The government also aims to enhance local communities and business to better contribute to quality of life for future generations.   Some of the work is based in previous mining areas of the UK which have suffered significant disadvantage through the loss of mining as income but also damage to the environment in these areas.  \n (Sustainability plan - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)Links to an external site..\nThe UK government have set targets to ensure better jobs and earning potential across all supply chains, developing prosperous communities across the UK, using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently, minimising ecological damage, considering the impact of climate change and minimising waste.\nCarry

responsibility and changing world of work.  Due to COVID 19 the speed of change across the world has intensified and organisations need to consider and develop these practices to be really sustainable and responsible businesses of the future.  They also need to consider problems the world is facing in relation to climate change, poverty, rising cost of living related to energy costs, online GP appointments and hospital visits and self-driving cars.  Producing foods including meets which are less harmful to the environment will be a key challenge for agriculture and overall a key investment

of right and wrong and we will consider this firstly from a moral, rather than a business perspective.  Ethical theory underpins the study of business ethics, and it is important that you have a grasp of this as you work through this module as you will need to demonstrate your understanding throughout the assessment.   Therefore the theory of ethics attempts to provide a clear, unified account of our own ethical obligations.  There are three main theories of ethics which you will review during this week – utilitarian, deontological and virtue ethics. \nHowever there are also Normative ethical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong from a given situation (Crane and Matten, 2016).  We will look at these in the next section.  They are important to the ways that businesses make decisions that can be defended, justified and explained to relevant stakeholders.  These theories will differ in terms of how you determine the moral worth of an action, and we will explore this during this week.  So where do ethics and theory of ethics come from?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\nv2.2 Where has ethics come from?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.2 Where has ethics come from?\n\nEthics is underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics and we will review each of these in this section.  There is a long history of ethical theory and the decision of right and wrong has been of utmost importance since life began and, in some cases, it is a matter of life and death for people across the world.\n\nFigure 1:  Image showing ethics underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics\nOver time the arenas for these ethical discussions have developed into organised religion, schools of philosophy, and political movements and parties.  The ethical discussions we have today, including those in a business context are, therefore, shaped by our own historical, religious, and cultural backgrounds, which can of course be very different depending on where we’re from.  And these categories have always and still do overlap.\n\nReligion\nRules and principles of religion advise us that there should be no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct or intoxicants through the religious teachings.  Religion and faith are a set of rules of how to act ethically and spiritually and there are consequences for the actions in terms of salvation, enlightenment, reincarnation or damnation. \nTherefore religion teaches us to:\ndemonstrate honesty and fidelity to family and those we know\nbe non-violent, demonstrate self-restraint, non-stealing, purity, truth\nconsider how every breach of promise in commerce is a sin\nlove one’s enemies, turn the other cheek\nhow morality for you and for others, including business behaviour\nLet’s look at religion and the six here are divided into three from the far east and south asia, and three what are called Abrahamic religions.\nBuddhism is concerned with the good life as we live it\nConfucianism the duty is more about people we know closely, more than the general responsibility to all others\nHinduism tenets are more universal, we should be like this with everyone\nJudaism is specific about business – more on this than on food/kosher etc in the holy texts.\nChristianity similar to Judaism but also talks of 7 sins and 7 virtues\nIslam forbids the charging of interest\nInfluence of religion endures today, however there are differences between Catholic/Lutheran and Calvinist traditions in Europe and the USA and there are specific injunctions around abstaining from economic life (holy days) or the practice of charging interest.  Interfaith declaration (1994) set key principles of justice; mutual respect; stewardship; honesty and recently religious figures have been commenting on business practice, investing or divesting wealth in various industries.   An example of this is where the Church of England tried to rescue Wonga (the loans company) and convert it to a non-profit organisation. It was asked to stop investing in Amazon, but hasn’t, despite saying it was a bad company.  The Church of England is an investor not just a faith and they have an investment fund valued at £9.2 billion which has been criticised for where it invests this funding, and this fund has received a return of 8.5% per year.  It plans to divest from fossil fuel companies by 2033, although some leading figures in the Church of England and its investment board have a background in companies like BP and Esso and therefore whether this will happen or not is open to discussion.\nThinking about Christianity and Easter and Christmas and business closure at these times of the year.  How do organisations overcome the differences when some of the employees do not celebrate these events and therefore eg have to have different practices in place for other religions?\nIn the UK there are still examples of traditional Christian practices such as lack of Sunday opening across some businesses and being the day when families attended church. \nWhat other practices can you think of that have a religious focus?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\n\nEthical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong for any given situation, for example:\nNormative ethical theories are those that propose to prescribe the morally correct way of acting\nDescriptive ethical theories seek to describe how ethics decisions are actually made in business\nWhen it comes to the role of ethical theory, there are two extreme positions\nEthical absolutism asserts eternal, universally applicable moral principles:\nRight and wrong are objective qualities, can be rationally determined\nEthical relativism claims morality is context-dependent and subjective:\nNo universal rights & wrongs that can be rationally determined, all depends on person making the decision, culture in which they operate\nThe following image shows a typology of ethical theories and how they are divided into conduct and character and then the different theories such as egoism, utilitarianism, Kantianism, Aristotelianism.\nCan you think of an example of poor ethical conduct at work?\nCan you think of poor ethical characters at work? \n2.4 Unilitariansim\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.4 Unilitariansim\n\nAccording to utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it results in the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people affected by the action, and also names as the “greatest happiness principle” which is based on a similar approach to cost-benefit analysis.  Jeremy Bentham contributed to this theory, and he suggested that “humans are motivated by avoidance of pain and gain of pleasure” resulting in “consequentialist” theory of ethics.  “Consequentialism” means the moral quality of an action is determined by its consequences eg right or wrong will depend on the consequences of an act eg lying is wrong but if it saved it a life then it would be right (moral quality of the action). \n\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724-1804) derived ethics of duty and argued that morality and decisions about right and wrong are not dependent on situation or actions.   He suggested that morality was defined by a set of moral rules that humans should apply to all relevant ethical problems (Crane and Matten, 2016).   He suggested three principles that constitute a “test” of whether a particular action should be ethical.\nPrinciple 1: Consistency - Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\nPrinciple 2: Human Dignity - Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only.\nPrinciple 3: Universality - Act only so that actions are “universally lawgiving” i.e. that rules guiding our actions are acceptable to every rational human being, not because they have been told to accept them i.e. would others agree with you?\n \nConsider the following transplant dilemma:\nA brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveller, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine check-up. In the course of doing the check-up, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor.\nDo you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.6 Virtue Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.6 Virtue Ethics\n\nVirtue ethics uses character and integrity-based approaches to business ethics with the message “good actions come from good persons” (Crane and Matten, 2016).   These contend that morally correct actions are those undertaken by actors with virtuous characters. Therefore, the formation of a virtuous character is the first step towards morally correct behaviour and not just a one-off decision Some of the acquired traits are:\nIntellectual virtues – “wisdom”\nMoral virtues – “honesty”, “courage,” “friendship”, “mercy”, “loyalty”, “modesty”, “patience” etc.\nEthics of virtue are central to the notion of “good life” and Aristotle argued that when we do something we do it to gain an end and that the ultimate end of all ends was the chief good, the greatest good.  Aristotle suggested that the best businessman is the one who practices virtue, not the one who makes the most money and this is because s/he can be satisfied with that goodness.   Therefore, if it’s good for you it will be good for all and thinking it’s good for all will help you be good.\n\nTopic 2\n2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\n\nEthics can be defined by natural rights or alternative frameworks that focus on relationships such as eg feminist ethics.  Natural rights are based on basic, important, unalienable entitlements that should be respected and protected in every single action, such as:\nbased on consensus about nature of human dignity\nstrongly based in western view of morality\nWhereas justice is the simultaneously fair treatment of individuals in a given situation with the result that everybody gets what they deserve such as:\nFair procedures (procedural justice)\nFair outcomes (distributive justice)\nThere are strong in the western tradition and flows from politics.  However should we all receive equal benefit?  Or should we strive for equal access to opportunity?\nThere are some limits of traditional theories in that they are:\nToo abstract\nToo reductionist\nToo objective and elitist\nToo impersonal\nToo rational and codified\nToo imperialist\nDo you think we look to alternative approaches?\n\nPlease use the accordions to reveal more information\nFeminist ethics\nDiscourse ethics\n\n\n\nPluralist approach\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.8 Ethical Decision making\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.8 Ethical Decision making\n\nEthical decision making is the process you would follow to ensure that decisions are based on ethical values.  For example, thinking of COVID-19 and health care professionals, many ethical dilemmas were presented in terms of making life and death decisions whilst allocating scarce resources eg such as the ventilators.  Ethical decision-making focuses on clarifying thinking about the issues, assist in the analysis of the issues involved and providing a rational way to defend a particular course of action.    Decisions have to be made on the best available information and information and personal choices must be respected.  These are generally concerned with decision making and particularly in making models of how this occurs, and ethical theories, principles and values can help but won’t solve the dilemma on their own. \nSo what is an ethical decision?  It is one that:\nIs likely to have significant effects on others\nIs likely to present with a number of choices\nOne or more party perceives this as an ethical question – even if you do not! If you use someone’s Netflix login you probably don’t care. Do they?\nThe diagram below provides a framework for understanding ethical decision making:\nFramework for understanding ethical decision-making\n2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\n\nRights and duties are really important in the workplace and Crane and Matten (2019, pg. 292) have produced a list resulting in a code of contract for ethical employment and it covers some of the “grey areas” which are not always covered by employment laws and regulations.\n \nFigure 4L  Rights and duties of employees (Crane and Matten, 2019, p.292)\nThe rights and duties of employees sets out the relationship between them and it offers the employees benefits in exchange for performance and for adhering to the rules.    Organisations need to provide training and outline the values of business ethics to employees in order to improve ethical decision-making in the workplace.  Senior leaders need to be the role models and demonstrate ethical behaviours and they need to be accountable for ethical violations and ensure they keep their promises and commitments to the workplace.   However organisations need to be careful as ethical decisions could be influenced by reward eg doing the right thing is rewarded for example, financially by managers and these practices need to be embedded within the values and practices demonstrated across the organisation.   Therefore ethical behaviour should be rewarded, and unethical behaviour should be punished.  Stakeholders have power to influence leaders and they should ensure that pressure is placed on stakeholders to act both ethically and unethically.\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\n\nThere is no longer a “job for life” and employees will experience different jobs and even careers across their working lives.   Post-Fordism is the term that is used to demonstrate how industrial production has moved away from huge production factories, pioneered by Henry Ford towards now where we have very much a knowledge economy.  In the Fordist era there were strong trade union representation and employees were given annual rises related to productivity and industrial peace (no strikes).  However we now are facing the rise of the “precariat” worker who has little or no job security (eg Uber drivers), little or no savings and many are often migrants to the UK or from BAME backgrounds.  Jobs such as Uber driving offers some semi-regular pay from very low-skilled work.  Currently young people have massive university debt that they are struggling to repay and graduates with a degree but few employment prospects.  As Uber drivers are classed as “workers” rather than “employees” they were not entitled to some basic rights such as sick leave, holiday pay and the minimum wage, however following a legal battle in 2021, Uber has now agreed to pay these to their drivers.  These drivers are typically contracted under non-standard arrangements eg on zero-hour contracts or independent contracts or through an agency.  These contracts really help employers cut costs and say in business; however it is a huge exploitation of individual employment rights. \n\nSome Business Examples of ethical practices during the Pandemic\nDuring the pandemic Cineworld closed down and staff found out through twitter and news reports rather than directly from management within the organisation.\nSecondly, Boohoo were part of the Levitt enquiry which focussed on duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain.\nThe enquiry found:\nBoohoo’s extraordinary commercial growth has been so fast that its governance processes have failed to keep pace.\nIt has concentrated on revenue generation sometimes at the expense of the other, equally important, obligations which large corporate entities have.\nIt has not felt responsible for conditions in the Leicester factories on anything other than a superficial level; and\nOn occasions it has failed to appreciate that with the enormous advantages of being a publicly listed company come responsibilities, one of which is on all occasions to act in the best interests of all the shareholders\nA conclusion was reached that the true reason that Boohoo did not become more involved in monitoring conditions in Leicester was that it saw it as being a lower priority than matters which directly affected the company (such as commercial issues or their own employees). The Leicester workers were not employed by them and so they were not their responsibility in the way that their own workforce is. To some extent this is understandable, but can lead to serious issues of the kind which Boohoo is now facing\nSports Direct and Amazon are also facing similar criticisms and you should read the case studies about some of their poor practices in the workplace:\nAmazon - Amazon raises wages amid criticism - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nSports Direct - Sports Direct staff 'not treated as humans', says MPs' report - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about these organisations?  Would it entice you to go and work for them?\n\nDiversity and Inclusion at Work\nDiversity and inclusion have become important practices within the workplace and research suggests that a more diverse workforce is good for business such as that:\nIt can lead to more creative problem solving, innovation, and being more responsive to change.\nGives a better knowledge of diverse markets / clients.\nOrganisation has a wider talent pool to draw from.\nIt can be a PR boost from being seen to manage diversity well.\nIt can lead to higher profits -10% increase in women in organisation linked to 3% in increase in profits\nMany organisations still have a white male orientated senior leadership team in the UK and although things have been changing BAME and women are still underrepresented at senior levels in organisations.   Part of this is due to women still being classified as care workers and working part-time to be carers.   The UK introduced the gender pay gap so that organisations with over 250 employees have to publish the differences in averages between men and women, however in 2021 there was still gaps in the amount men and women were paid eg in education women were paid 26% less than men.  Gary Lineker working for the BBC was the second highest paid star at the corporation and paid more than women in similar roles.  Organisations have to address these challenges through fair procedures and although discrimination is wrong, poor practices in the workplace are still being evidenced.  This is an area for conflict as employees want to be paid the fairest and highest pay whilst employers want to pay the lowest to increase their profits and there has to be balance between high pay and high profits. \n \n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nIssues Involved\nRight to freedom from discrimination.\nEqual opportunities.\nAffirmative action.\nReverse discrimination.\nSexual and racial harassment.\nRight to privacy\nHealth and drug testing.\nWork-life balance.\nPresenteeism.\nElectronic privacy and data protection.\nRight to due process\nPromotion.\nFiring.\nDisciplinary proceedings.\nRight to participation and association.\nOrganization of workers in works councils and trade unions.\nParticipation in the company's decisions.\nRight to healthy and safe working conditions.\nWorking conditions.\nOccupational health and safety.\nRight to fair wages.\nPay.\nIndustrial action.\nNew forms of work.\nRight to freedom of conscience and speech.\nWhistleblowing.\nRight to work.\nFair treatment in the interview.\nNon-discriminatory rules for recruitment.\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nIssues Involved\nDuty to comply with labour contract\nAcceptable level of performance.\nWork quality.\nLoyalty to the firm.\nDuty to comply with the law.\nBribery\nDuty to respect the employer's property.\nWorking time.\nUnauthorized use of company resources for private purpose:\nFraud, theft, embezzlement.\n\nSUBSECTIONS TO COVER:\n\nPurpose:\n- Requirements: Define key terms and set out the approach to the assignment.\n- Word Count: 350\n- Theories/Models: Triple Bottom Line (TBL)\n- Required Readings: Crane & Matten (2016)\n\nENHANCED GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

Or should organisations who make the wealth and set the standards we work to and live by be the ones that dictate this fairness?\nThere are some obvious talking points here, not just in the UK but across the world as authoritarian leaders focus on national interests to change behaviours.  However culture also plays a part as it needs to consider the interactions between different groups across society.  The following examples discuss how culture impacts different groups in everyday existence.\n\nFor example, in 2019 Parkfield primary school, a largely Muslim school suspended lessons about LGBT rights and homophobia following protests from parents.  The lessons had been designed to help children accept differences in society and teach them about religion, gender identify, age and disabilities.  However following criticism from some of the schools’ Muslim parents relating to same sex-couples education in the lessons the school suspended these lessons.  Parents insisted that the classes were not appropriate for their children by keeping them at home from lessons on a Friday.  The school suspended the lessons and the children returned to school.\nA second example is where an older generation of feminists (represented by JK Rowling) were confronted by angry activists for not supporting trans rights.  Rowling took to Twitter following a tweet that read “people who menstruate” instead of what she should thought should be “women who menstruate” and then went to add “If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. . . . I do not believe it’s hateful to say so.” (NY Post, 2020).  This tweet resulted in thousands of replies declaring Rowling a transphobic, bigoted TERF (trans-exclusion radical feminist) and impact of globalisation and different cultures and their values.\nSome of the factors that contribute to these differences are identified through Demographic methods (DEMOG).  Recent political surveys have shown huge generational differences between how older and younger adults view issues from climate change, through to Brexit and immigration and up to how we should respond to the pandemic.  However gender differences are more nuanced such as where the majority of white women voted for Trump to be elected, compared with less among white men.\nEconomic factors can also influence perceptions and views across society.  For example, automation can cost jobs, or improve productivity.  Which way do you think it will go?  The world of work has been changing significantly over the last few years, but Covid has also speeded this up with more hybrid and home working.\nGlobalisation is another factor that has significantly impacted sustainability and responsible business practice as it focuses on the key context for business practice such as through imports, exports and business location.  Globalisation has seen businesses being able to buy, sell and produce goods across the world, sometimes buying materials at a lower cost or producing where labour is most experienced or even cheaper to help with their own bottom line.  Globalisation is a topic that we will review throughout this module and each of the weeks to come.\nThe image below shows the largest container ship, which represents an emblem of the steady growth in international trade since the mid-90s, when the Word Trade Organisation, the global body dealing with the rules of trade, was established.   Up to 2021 the value of global trade had reached a record level of $28.5 trillion which was an increase of 25% on 2020 and 13% higher than 2020 (Unctad, 2021). \n\nFig1:  World Trade Organisation (2020)\nEven more dramatically, since 1950 we have seen a total increase in trade volumes of 4220%.  So what does this mean for you, your organisation and sustainability and responsible business practice?\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment and is as important as making and growing the organisation.  Organisations need to be productive without negatively impacting people, the planet or the environment and one way they  can do this is through ethical behaviour.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\nv1.2 Ethics and the Law\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.2 Ethics and the Law\n\nBusiness ethics is the study of business situations, activities and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed such as through how different organisations treat their customers, their staff, the planet and even their suppliers (Crane and Matten, 2016).  They are interrelated terms that can exist separately although most ethical considerations and are usually legally enforceable.  They describe the ways business should behave. It provides the social, cultural, legal and economic limitations to protect the interests of various stakeholders.  It also emphasis moral and social values such as welfare, consumer protection and fair business practices.   For example, thinking about the introduction of the government policy relating to plastic shopping bags.  This policy was to emphasis sustainability and to protect resources for future generations as well as reducing the use of single-use carrier bags to encourage people to reuse bags.  The scheme has so far worked as there has been a reduction of supplied single-use carrier bags  by over 95% and the money raised has totalled nearly £180m for good causes.\nBusiness needs to operate ethically to be successful and they need to create their own ethical business practices (EBP) which includes a culture where individuals in the business make decisions and act in ways that build sustainable business.  They also need to show a care for all the needs of the stakeholders working within these ethical and legal guidelines. Organisations that demonstrate unethical behaviours are usually named and shamed on social media sites and research has shown that up to 50% of customers are concerned with unethical businesses practices and are therefore prepared to move their business to more ethically proven business.  \n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.3 Globalisation\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.3 Globalisation\n\nAccording to Scholte (2005) globalization is not:\n‘internationalization’\n‘liberalization’\n‘universalization’\n‘westernization’\nGlobalization is a process which diminishes the necessity of a common and shared territorial basis for social, economic, and political activities, processes, and relations  and can result in deterritorialization (where a territory has its organisation destroyed through growth of cultural flows).   As we have seen earlier, globalisation has intensified since 1989 and this has  been caused by the collapse of the Eastern Block (former communist states in East and Central Europe eg Soviet Union, Albania, Yugoslavia for example) in 1989 when the cold war came to an end and the Berlin Wall came down.  This resulted in wider range of countries opening their borders and allowing people to escape to the West.   China has also contributed to global wealth during this time through foreign investment resulting in it boosting its exports of technology and capital which has allowed it to grow to be the second largest economy after the US. \nThere are many organisations that have benefitted from globalisation, and I imagine you can name a few.  However, one of the organisations that has benefitted from this is Nike who has manufacturing plants in almost every country of the world except Russia, most of African and some of the Middle East.  Nike’s set up factories across the world and now employ over 1.02 million workers in 42 countries to produce all its products.  29% of its products are made in China and 44% in Vietnam.  Only 76,000 of employees are actually employed by Nike.  However through globalisation Nike has been able to extend is sale of products and services from US to all over the world developing its brand and economic success. \n\n\nEconomically, there are gains, but how are these gains distributed across the different countries of the world?\nInterestingly, Switzerland, Ireland and Holland are in the top 3 countries across the world that have benefitted in terms of growth of income with Ireland being one of the most globalised economies.  The globalisation index by the Bertelsmann Foundation measures economic, political and social aspects of worldwide network economies and ranks countries overall.  Ireland has increased its globalisation rating due to its favourable climate, its central location between North America and Asia and its tourism appeal.  Ireland has also attracted foreign investment through these positive characteristics but also through having the population who are fluent in English.  The republic of Ireland has been a full member of the EEU and therefore been able to position itself well, particularly in relation to Brexit.  It also has low population density which means that there is room for growth.\nGlobalisation has allowed for free trade; it has lowered or abolished tariffs which has  increased the movement of labour and goods across several countries.  This has allowed organisations to focus on an area in which it represents competitive advantage such as through lack of regulation of global financial or cheaper labour.  Shareholders have sometimes looked at profit over ethical working practices, and example of this is Primark. In 2009, Primark were found to be employing illegal workers and paying their staff less than the minimum wage by using child labourers to produce their garments in refugee camps in Southern India.  The working conditions were very poor, but this child labour enabled Primark to grow through cheap production costs in a country outside of the UK.  This negatively impacted their brand and Primark has worked hard to rectify these poor practices over the last few years by signing up to an Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI’s) base code of labour practices based aligned to the International Labour Organisation standards.  This is an example of where Primark was able to outsource production to developing countries in order to reduce their costs in the global marketplace.  This has been positive as it provides jobs in these developing countries, but it also raises the potential for exploitation of employees through poor working conditions.  More than this, jobs in industrialized regions of developed countries have been put at risk, something which Donald Trump talked about very effectively in the 2016 US election. \nGlobalization can bring cheaper prices to consumers, but vulnerable consumers in developing countries may also face the possibility of exploitation by Multinational Corporations (MNCs).  These products can provide social benefits to consumers; however this can also be met with protests about cultural imperialism and westernization in less wealthy countries.   Global business activity brings the company in direct interaction with local communities and has the possibility of raising the erosion of traditional community life.\n\nGlobally active pressure groups emerge with aim to “police” corporations in counties where governments are weak and corrupt.  One example of global pressure groups is Greenpeace.  It was formed in 1971 to protect natural resources.  They are currently working with others to protect our natural world due to rising sea levels, extreme weather as the climate breaks down through destructive industries which pollutes forests, oceans and the air.  In 2020, they protested against Shall Oil and their plan to pollute the North Sea by abandoning an estimated 11,000 tonnes of oil on the sea.  The protestors on the Greenpeace Ship, Esperanza approached a 500m exclusion zone of Shell’s platform waving banners and calling on Shell to clean up its mess. \n\nFigure 2:  Greenpeace at Brent Oil Rigs (The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site.)\nShell wanted to dismantle these platforms in the sea as cheaply as possible, putting profit before people, however Greenpeace insisted that these platforms must be removed in an environmentally friendly manner.   You can read more about the Brent Story and Shell’s sustainability here - The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site..  As at March 2022 a decision is on the way but as, yet this has not been published.\nGlobalization weakens governments and increases corporate responsibility, for example, jobs, welfare, maintenance of ethical standards through increased budgetary pressures. Globalization confronts governments with corporations from regions with different cultural expectations about issues such as bribery, corruption, taxation, and philanthropy and decisions have to be made how to co-operate in an ethical and legal way, for example when organisations try to bribe the local government officials to accept their plan for redevelopment of premises, for example which is not in the best interests of the local community.\n\nHowever, globalization is good for all of us as it provides us with a much wider range of products and services and access to experiences we would not have in our own country.  However, turning our backs on globalization would take us down the wrong path.   It is the emerging and developing countries which have achieved only below average levels in the globalization index thus far and therefore still have great potential to globalize. By doing so, they could generate correspondingly high globalization-induced growth effects. This is why it is essential that emerging countries become better integrated into the global economy. In industrialized countries, it is necessary to spread the benefits of globalization more widely so that social acceptance of an open society is not lost.” Overall, if globalization (measured by various indicators) increases by 1%, there is a .33% increase in GDP.    You can read more about the global index here:  https://kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2021/12/kof-globalisation-index-2021.html#:~:text=The%20KOF%20Globalisation%20Index%20measures,the%20period%201970%20to%202019Links to an external site..\nThere is, however, considerable variation in impact on inequality in the developed world.  Broadly, in the US and UK, inequality has risen with globalization. In continental Europe and Japan, it hasn’t.  For example,  Equal Opportunities legislation has tried to target and ensure procedural justice is promoted through best practices and prosecuting those that do not comply.  In addition, pressure groups have grown in recent years attempting to address the social imbalances such as the Black Lives Matter movement who were founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer.  Their mission has been to eradicate white supremacy and build local power or to intervene in violence which is inflicted on Black communities.  This group has gained momentum through the murder of George Floyd and the group is being supported by celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton.   This is an example of a group that tries to advance the rights of under-represented individuals. However, there are many more.\nOrganisations have to comply with equal opportunities legislation such as the Equality Act 2010 in the UK and ensure for example during the recruitment practices, policies are fair and do not discriminate applications based on eg sex, race, age, religion etc.  Job descriptions need to be produced which provide fair criteria which applicants can be assessed against and use wording that does not discriminate applications, for example “only white males need to apply”.\nOnce individuals have been employed in an organisation then training programmes need to be open and fair to all of them, for example running programmes at a time of day that part-time staff can attend.  Organisations must ensure that they do not prioritise certain staff over others in terms of promotion to senior positions, particularly those from discriminated groups. \nOrganisations have moved to more diversity workforces and organisations like M&S and Metropolitan police have used targeted campaigns in London to try and address racial inequality through promoting equal opportunity for all, although they have had to be careful to ensure recruitment is still fair to all.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\n\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment, and it seeks to promote best practices to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources when developing products and services.   In 2022 we have seen souring temperatures across the UK and wildfires caused through climate change.  Organisations need to develop products and services without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs such as eg combating the o-zone layer (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)\nSustainability refers to the long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic and social considerations. \nOne of the ways to do this is through the triple bottom line:\n\nFigure 3:  Triple Bottom Line\nThe Triple bottom line model discussed by John Elkington in 1984 moved away from businesses focussing solely on financial performance but looked at people, planet and profitability which provided organisations with insight into the connections between environmental health, social wellbeing and the organisations financial success.\nThe traditional bottom line – profit – is supplemented by novel ways of accounting for an organisation's performance with respect to:\nPeople. How does the organisation stand in its treatment of employees, customers and the wider community? Is it doing all it can to maximise its performance in these areas?\nPlanet. How well is the organisation doing in its treatment of the natural environment? Is it using more resources than it needs to? Is it damaging the environment, through pollution or through making products, with poor environmental performance?\nAs we might expect from a model based on accounting, the triple bottom line model is particularly useful in providing checklists of areas of sustainability performance which an organisation should examine carefully.\nThe triple bottom line model can usefully be applied to all profit-making organisations and can also prove useful for non-profit organisations as well. For example, the diagram above has a close fit, in many areas, to the activities of an organisation like Anglia Ruskin University, since we have to pay attention to nearly all of the items listed in the diagram above – apart from total shareholder return.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.5 Covid-19\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.5 Covid-19\n\nSo what about the pandemic? What implications are there for business ethics?  Through the government measures to stem the spread of coronavirus some companies have positively put their employees before their profits ensuring both staff and customer safety as an overwhelming priority.  They have also cut executive pay rather than avoiding rising costs to customers. \nHowever, the government has bailed out companies on the brink of bankruptcy and has propped up wages of workers through furlough scheme which impacts organisations and society and does bring a question in terms of the balance of fairness. Organisations such as Netflix stated they would stop charging inactive customers and Unilever pledged to stop targeting children with adverts. Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on jobs, profits, trade and movement and even 4 years later travel is still a long way from where it used to be, however it has brought some positives in terms of hybrid working for employees, but this has also been at a cost to the high street.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 –Introduction to Sustainability & Responsible Business > 1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\n\nHere are 8 reasons why business ethics is a vital subject.  \nThese are:\nIt has power and influence of business in society\nPotential to provide major contribution to society\nPotential to inflict harm\nIncreasing demands from stakeholders\nLack of business ethics education or training\nContinued occurrence of ethical infractions\nEvaluating different ways of managing business ethics\nInteresting and rewarding\nCan you add any others?\nTherefore, throughout this first study week you have been introduced to some of the key concepts of sustainability and responsible business and the importance of ethical business practices.\n\nTopic 1\n\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nSocial\nPolitical\nCultural\nDemographic\nEconomic\nEquality\nDivisions\nPrejudice\nGenerational\nInequality\nFairness\nInstitutions\nXenophobia\nGender\nCSR\nMobility\nDemocracy\nRacism\nMigration\nBad practice\nVulnerability\nAccountability\nReligion\nWar\nTechnology\n \nTrade\nTraditions\nFamine\nGrowth\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761a8e-20564-Topic_3.docx ---\n3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Crisis > 3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\n\nThe United Nations was founded in 1945 with 51 original Member States and this international organisation is comprised of 193 Member States today.  The UN defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations.  The UN set up a commission to review the problems of economic development where global resources are limited.  Economists argued that economies could not grow as natural resources were finite and were becoming more difficult to obtain.  Therefore, if economic activity was to be 'sustainable' into the far future, more attention would have to be paid to rate at which resources were consumed.

The 8 goals were realistic and easy to communicate, with a clear measurement and monitoring mechanism.   However, in 2012 UN developed a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)s to fit the global development framework beyond 2015.  This created a new people-centred, development agenda and engaged citizens, scientists, academics and private sector in the process and created 17 new goals:\n\nFigure 2:  UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2015)\n\n3.4 Climate Change\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals & the Climate Crisis > 3.4 Climate Change\n\nClimate change is already impacting public health, food and water security, migration, peace and security. Climate change, left unchecked, will roll back the development gains we have made over the last decades and will make further gains impossible.  The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) outlined some agreements in terms of the global agenda on climate change for the next decade and the\nCountries agreed to:\nmeet further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide to try to keep temperate rises within 1.5oC\nreduce the use of coal\nincrease money to poor countries to help with effects of climate change\nphase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or natural gas\nUS and China to cooperate and switch to clean energy\nstop deforestation by 2030\nClimate change impacts our food in terms of weather conditions such as increase in temperatures and rain fall which impact the quality of our foods, such as flooding the fields and destroying the crops.  Mortality rates can increase due to impact of food availability and can limit worker productivity.  Flooding can spread disease and damage the ecosystem and therefore, lowering emissions is believed to be one of the biggest impacts on lessening harmful impacts to health. \nIn 2021, the UN reported that more than 59 million people were displaced within their homelands through weather related events such as floods, storms and cyclones. \n\nFigure 4:  Unocha:  A displaced persons camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nOrganisations that revisit production practices and work on reducing emissions through good practices will help overcome some of the challenges with climate change.  Governments can help address social problems such as through global financial markets, climate and the internet and therefore there are many areas of business that are not explicitly regulated.  There is expectation that businesses will address these volatile financial markets, consider climate change during their production processes and consider issues such as internet privacy. \nRead the case study on page 133 of the core text “the politics of the oil sands” and the different stances of both the US and Canadian governments and the impact this is having on climate change.\n\nTopic 3\nPrevious\nNext\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nGoal 1\nEradicate extreme poverty and hunger\nGoal 2\nAchieve universal primary education\nGoal 3\nPromote gender equality and empower women\nGoal 4\nReduce child mortality\nGoal 5\nImprove maternal health\nGoal 6\nCombating HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other diseases\nGoal 7\nEnsure environmental sustainability\nGoal 8\nDevelop a global partnership for development\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nGoal 1Links to an external site.\nEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere\nGoal 2Links to an external site.\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture\nGoal 3Links to an external site.\nEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\nGoal 4Links to an external site.\nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all\nGoal 5Links to an external site.\nAchieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\nGoal 6Links to an external site.\nEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\nGoal 7Links to an external site.\nEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all\nGoal 8Links to an external site.\nPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all\nGoal 9Links to an external site.\nBuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation\nGoal 10Links to an external site.\nReduce inequality within and among countries\nGoal 11Links to an external site.\nMake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\nGoal 12Links to an external site.\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns\nGoal 13Links to an external site.\nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\nGoal 14Links to an external site.\nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development\nGoal 15Links to an external site.\nProtect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss\nGoal 16Links to an external site.\nPromote peaceful and inclus\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761c02-20564-Topic_4.docx ---\n4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\n\nThe actions that consumers take have an impact other people and those impacts can be positive or negative.  This is an example of a tweet that appeared discussing some of the problems with Amazon’s same delivery service and the impacts this has on the workers to search for, find and deliver products and services the same day. There are also the environmental impacts such as additional pollution in the environment.  Read the tweet below and then consider the questions below:\n\nWhen you order something for same day delivery do you consider the impact this has on workers or the environment and if so, would it persuade you to consider not same day deliver?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\nv4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\n\nOne of the key ethical tensions is between consumer rights versus the consequences of these activities.  The Declaration of Independence gave three examples of inalienable rights which were, to “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness”.  Sometimes these are known as natural rights.  Therefore, it is important to consider the following questions:\ndo consumers have a right to a product if the consequences of this are bad for society and/or the environment?\ndo consumers have a right to a product at a fair price?\ndo consumers have a duty to favour ethical companies in their purchasing decisions?\nObviously, the answer to some of these questions such as fair price is yes, however the consequences of this needs to be considered, e.g., is the fair price due to unfair labour practices such as child workers or paying below the minimum requirements then is it fair?\nConsumers have inalienable entitlements to fair treatment when entering into exchanges with sellers and there is a belief that consumer dignity should be respected.  Sellers have a duty to treat consumers as ends in themselves and not only as means to the end of the seller.  This should prevent misleading or deceptive practices and should aggregate social, cultural and environmental good practices.  These should therefore reduce inequality, exploitation, physical, emotional, mental and socio-cultural harm. \n\nThinking of tourism as an industry which includes human behaviour, the use of resources, communication with people, economies, the environment and the physical movement of the tourists to location impacts a number of different communities in both positive and negative ways. \nPositively tourism brings money into the community, can help with job creation, brings investment and triggers economic growth. \nNegatively it impacts the environment in terms of pollution, the ecosystem in terms of use of water taken e.g., for swimming pools from other needed community sources or through the clearing of vegetation for hotels and resorts to build these near beaches or in core areas of the forest.  Walking can trample and destroy coastlines leading to a loss of species and destruction of habitats.   Cultural diversity can also be reduced, and this is known as cultural homogenisation which refers to the reduction in cultural diversity through popularisation and diffusion of cultural symbols or customs, ideas and values which become absorbed by the dominant outside culture.\n An example of this is McDonalidization where fast food restaurants are dominating around the world meaning that the same health standards are being adopted across the world and therefore this can have a negative impact on health and are changing the food choices of the country before McDonalidization.\nCrane et al., 2019, identified a number of ethical issues for consumers within key industries as shown below:\n\nFigure 1:  Ethical issues for consumer within key industries.\nCan you think of any others? \nOrganisations need to deal with consumers ethical such as ensuring product safety and fitness for purpose or making sure during marketing activities there are no misleading claims or price fixing for example. \n\nOne of the issues that consumers criticise companies of is pricing.  Consumers want to purchase these as at the lowest cost, but companies want to sell these for the maximum amount to increase their revenue.  In most countries, regulatory agencies police price fixing – however the main issues that are arise are:\nExcessive pricing – price gouging – that the fair prices for goods and services has been exceeded.  This may be based on market conditions.\nPrice fixing – collusion between competing firms to fix prices above the market rate – this is illegal in Europe and US but other countries of the word it can go unnoticed.\nPredatory pricing – anticompetitive practice when firm sets the price significantly lower than market rate to force out the competition.\nDeceptive pricing – true cost is deliberately obscured and sometimes the airline industry has been found to advertise prices which are only available on a few flights with substantial booking restrictions and no information about the additional taxes or charges.\nHave you experienced any of these practices?  What do you think?  How ethical are these companies?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\n\nTwo theories can be applied to consumers and the consequences of actions.  The first is deontological ethics which applies to consumer rights as it provides an underlying principle of an action that is good or right?  It assumes that good decisions are made by adhering to ‘good’ principles and doing the right thing because it is the right thing to do.  If you follow rules and fulfil duties. \nDeontological ethics relies on the normative theory that morality of action is based on whether the action is right or wrong rather than based on the consequences of the action, for example do not kill, do not steal, follow religious beliefs and keep promises made. \nHowever, in contrast,  teleological ethics consider the consequences of actions and if they are morally the best (or consequentialist ethics).  For example, killing for promotion is wrong but killing in self-defence could be deemed as moral and the right decision made on the best consequences.  It therefore considers the outcome of the action good being good and whether the goal of the action or decision leads to good outcomes.  Overall, the better outcomes an action produces, the better it is.\nThis image shows the differences between the two:\n\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\n\nAs you have already started to see, consumers have various rights when purchasing goods and services and in the UK they are protected by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  This act gives the consumer a legal right to a refund for goods or services that are unsatisfactory or unfit for use or to get it repaired in certain circumstances.\nIn 2009, Tata Motors introduced a new model, The Tata Nano and described it as ‘The People’s Car’  with a price of around £1,075 at launch, with the price dropping by 30% within a year.  It was stated to be safer than alternative models of transport such as motorbikes, scooters, motor-rickshaws, and it was a lot cheaper.  It therefore potentially satisfied millions of lower-income people dream of owning a car. \nHowever, on the other hand, it was potentially ‘socially and environmentally disastrous’ as it was bringing countries to gridlock through increased traffic, pollution was impacted through the use of motor vehicles, damaging the environment.  In addition, the land for Nano factories had  been acquired controversially as some of the land had previously been the ‘most fertile’ farmland in locality.\nHowever, in 2010 reports emerged of fires in a handful of Nanos, amid wider concerns that cost-cutting made the car unreliable and safe, and it was discontinued in 2020 due to safety concerns. \nConsider the following question:\nDo people in developing countries have the right to products available to developed countries if these will have net negative consequences for society / the environment?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\n\nThis was one of the questions highlighted earlier – do you think consumers do have the right to a fair price?\nConsumers do have the right to a fair price and as we have seen in earlier topics, employers and employees can conflict during the production process as employers want to minimise costs and maximise revenue through reduced costs such as lower wages resulting in tensions between consumers and producers to maximise this cost revenue.   An example of this is that in 2015, Martin Shkreli was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a 60-year-old life-saving drug by over 5000% overnight taking the costs from $13.50 to $750 in the USA and by comparison it costs $0.66 in the UK.  His company had a monopoly on the drug, and this was not the first-time aggressive pricing has been brought in.  However even 2.5 years later the price hadn’t changed but the company was trying to make it less expensive to hospitals.   He was solely motivated by profits and was successful as there was no alternative to the drug for low-income patients.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.6 Ethical Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.6 Ethical Consumption\n\nProfessor Craig Smith, in 1995 and 1996 published research relating to ethical consumption and how consumers were boycotting unethical companies showing how customers do take ethical considerations into purchasing decisions.    Thinking  back to the child workers and poor labour practices in the production of Primark’s clothing, customers could have boycotted Primark until they resolved these unethical practices.\nHowever, boycotting unethical companies was found not to be consistent, and companies could justify unethical consumption.  Think about chocolate production and how Fairtrade was introduced.  Fairtrade is about better prices, safe working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers.  Fairtrade ensures that workers are paid fairly and providing better terms of the farmers.  Would you boycott a company that was producing chocolate unethically?  Would the companies survive?\nIn perfect competition (where  in a market buyers and sellers are so numerous and well informed that all elements of monopoly are absent and the market price of a commodity is beyond the control of individual buyers and sellers), customer demand drives market. \nThis means that the customer is King, and the customers will move to a different seller if they are not satisfied.  Therefore, is consumer sovereignty the ‘Key’ to truly ethical consumption? \nA consumer sovereignty test can measure:\nconsumer capability to make free decisions without vulnerability or coercion.\nhow readily available, good quality information is relating to products.\nchoice between similar products with affordable switching costs.\nHaving the capability to choose between similar products, with good information about companies’ ethical stances enables consumers to make choices such as where there has been any animal testing, or the products have been produced in a sweatshop or used child labour.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\n\nDisaster capitalism refers to the development of profits based on some type of disaster.   For example, Donald Trump proposed a $700 billion dollar stimulus plan to eliminate payroll taxes which would lead to a reduction in social security funding.  Some other governors said that they wanted nothing to do with this plan as it was too expensive and how it would impact state and local funding as it was to divert the funds.  Sometimes, unethical conduct can pay more than ethical conduct, however in this case the plan was not implemented. \nAnother example is from Nathan Rothschild (c.1815), who said, “The best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.”  He made his fortune buying in the panic following the Battle of Waterloo as the better the opportunities, the better the profit. \nHowever, Warren Buffet warned that you can pay a high price in the stock market, particularly if everyone agrees with your investment decision.   Therefore, where there is social and economic turmoil this results in an opportunity and can lead to prospective business deals.  Consumers and citizens maybe too tired or distracted of what is happening to resist the changes.  This leads to the debate about ethical and unethical behavior.\nDo you think it is ethical to profit from the pandemic? \nNews stories relating to the amount of government spending and the unethical contracts awarded by ministers has led to discussions relating to unethical behavior.  However, organisations such as Netflix and Amazon have clearly profited from the pandemic due to increased home shopping and people staying at home.   Billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic, with top executives from technology and industry earning the most. \nThe world's richest saw their wealth climb 27.5% to $10.2trn (£7.9trn) from April to July this year, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS.  That was up from the previous peak of $8.9trn at the end of 2017 and largely due to rising global share prices.  UBS said billionaires had done \"extremely well\" in the Covid crisis and it also said the number of billionaires had hit a new high of 2,189, up from 2,158 in 2017.  However, it is expected that 150 million people, have been predicted to fall into extreme poverty next year, due to climate change, war, and now the pandemic, which is a new record.\nDo you think that companies should be rewarded for doing the right thing?  Should we not punish them for doing the wrong thing?  Are they doing the wrong thing?\nThinking about fast fashion, which is a business model that relies on cheap and speedy production of low-quality clothing which is rapidly produced and cycled in and out of the market quickly to meet new trends.  \nFashion brand Zara, coined the phrase stating it took them only 15 days to design, produce and sell garments in their stores.  This allowed them to develop more styles and to differentiate their fashion garments at a lower price through cheap and rapid production which is an example of encouraging excessive consumption. \nTheir business model encourages consumers to purchase cheap clothing and discard them quickly creating environmental problems through accumulating mountains of textiles and clothing every day, which are not biodegradable.\n After the deaths of 1,134 people during the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh Aleya Akter, a local union leader, expressed concerns that raising working standards in the country would cause businesses to pull out from the country.  He suggested that, as much as workers blame the brands for letting things get so bad in the first place, the last thing they want is for the industry to disappear”. \nThere are about 4 million garment workers and it’s impossible for them to get work anywhere else, because this is what they’re skilled to do. Not only are we asking for compensation for the brands, but we are also asking them: Do not walk away from us. Do not walk away from Bangladesh.\"\nCan consumers claim that their demand for fast fashion is ethical because it leads to jobs and investment in the developing world? \n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\n\nStudy Activity\nIn the 1970s South Africa and Apartheid was a system where legislation upheld segregation policies against non-white citizens.  Government policies were developed that discriminated socially, economically and politically against black majority.  However, these unethical practices called for international economic sanctions against South Africa, though these were not fully enforced.  This resulted in ‘Ethical’ companies which ceased business and some less ethical businesses continued.  Apartheid ended in the 1990s when FW de Klerk (South African president), repealed most of the social legislation, however racial segregation remained due to deeply entrenched in society.  Nelson Mandela was a key antiapartheid activist and the countries first black president. \nCoca Cola.docx\nActions\n \n\nRead through Coke and Pepsi’s response to apartheid.

The Ethical Consumer article focuses on Amazon's negative impact, especially its unethical practices like poor treatment of workers, environmental damage, tax avoidance, and data misuse. It takes a critical ethical stance, encouraging people to think beyond cheap prices and question the company’s actions. This reflects the moral absolutist or deontological stance mentioned in the lecture, where actions are judged as right or wrong regardless of the results.\nOn the other hand, the MoneySavingExpert article is more focused on deals and savings. It doesn’t talk about ethics—it simply helps people get the best prices on Amazon. This matches the consequentialist stance, where the outcome (saving money) is more important than how the company behaves.\nMy View on Amazon and Ethical Shopping:\nPersonally, I use Amazon sometimes, but I do feel uncomfortable about many of its practices, like worker mistreatment and avoiding taxes. I believe in ethical shopping, but I also know it’s not always easy or affordable. I try to buy from better companies when I can, especially for clothes, food, and home items.\nYes, I think some things are serious enough to boycott a company, like:\nModern slavery\nAnimal cruelty\nEnvironmental harm\nMistreating workers on purpose\nIf I know a company does these things and doesn’t try to improve, I would stop supporting them. I believe companies should care about people, animals, and the planet—not just profit.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1

and regulations\n\nThe government in the UK are elected for up to five years and they develop the legislation and codes of practices that businesses have to abide by to survive.  The Government include a variety of institutions and actors that operate at different levels and that share a common power to issue laws, specifically at transnational, national, regional and local level.  The legislation serves as a codification which relates to explicit rules of social consensus about what society regards as right or wrong. \nFor example, one of the latest Acts of Parliament that has been updated in 2021 is the UK Environment Act.  This legislation was introduced following Brexit as previous EU rules on water quality, clean air and environmental protects were at risk were covered by European legislation.   This act sets the targets for e.g., air quality and water quality and waste reduction.  In March 2022 Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) in the UK launched a consultation to identify longer term targets, however as there were problems with the consultation process, this was extended to the 27th of June.\nIn addition to legislation, individuals and organisations are government by regulation which are the rules that are issued by governmental actors and other delegated authorities to constrain, enable, or encourage particular business behaviors.  Regulation includes rule definitions, laws, mechanisms, processes, sanctions, and incentives and for example businesses are expected to provide transparent, consistent and comparable information to investors and stakeholders in terms of environmental, social and corporate governance.  These areas are also coming under regulatory action such as corporate sustainability reporting or sustainable investment or sustainable financial disclosure.\nIn the UK we have a number of rregulatory bodies who ensure that rules and regulations are put into practice across business such as DEFRA, or the Forestry Commission or the Environment Agency. \nRegulation is enforced through imperative regulation, which means that government regulations are backed by sanction mechanisms, for example the police, military, courts and parliaments, which leads it to being strong way to enforce the rules. \nThe second method is through private regulation which is issued by companies, industry associations or civil society groups, and these may be binding, however sanctioning mechanisms being softer and more indirect such as company rules such as not creating a hostile work environment.\n\nTopic

a stakeholder in business\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, the government acts as the representative of citizens, and is expected to define the conditions which business must meet in order to operate, for example:\nWhat environmental laws to follow\nThe level of corporate taxation that organisations need to pay and.\nWhether one large company can merge with another\nThe aim of the government is to be re-elected, not just to serve its citizens and therefore is made up be elected individuals and these individuals have noble aims as they want to be re-elected in the future.  Their interests usually align with business to make business strong which should result in a booming economy, happy people with jobs and them having an income to spend across the community.  However they are also able to influence by competition in terms of education, health and entertainment such as through local authority owned theatres vs commercially owned or charitable theatres. \nThis image gives an outline as the government as a stakeholder of business:\n\n \nFigure 1:  Government as a stakeholder of business (Crane, et al., 2019, p482)\nOn the left-hand side of the image you will see that the government in principle represents an entire community since it is elected by the citizens of a certain town, region, country or even continent.  In this role as the elected representative of citizens’ interests.  This means that they define the conditions for the licence to operate of business as well as restricting and enabling business.  There is some debate about the degree of governmental responsibility for a functioning economy for example such as through laissez-faire vs. forceful role in industrial policy. \nOn the right hand of the image, the government have a self-interest to be re-elected and therefore they are very dependent on business and also compete with business.  In March 2022, the UK government has published significant reform proposals to drive change in competition and consumer law policy with the aim of boosting trade following Brexit.\nIt could be argued that the government has a conflict of interest between creating jobs and regulating business interests.  This image from Crane and Matten (2019) shows some of these relations and conflicts of interest as well as identifying some of the main sources of ethical problems which stem from fiduciary relation to society in general. \nThis shows Society on the right and the Government in the middle who are setting the standards and regulations in the UK to provide a stable environment for businesses to operate within. On the Right and in this stable environment business provides the taxes eg corporation, VAT etc to the government through providing employment and good work leading to growth in the economy.  Through business activities the government reviews how they can protect citizens in society such as through environmental regulations, paternity leave, minimum wage and other employment regulation and interventions.  These are signals from the government that they are looking after citizens and ensuring business protect Society.  However, the government are caught in the middle of conflicting demands in a bipolar situation.\n\nFigure 2:  Government between business and society interests (Crane et al, 2019, p.486)\nTherefore here we can see that business can have significant impact and influence on the implementation of government policies and business influence legitimacy and accountability are questioned.  Business can expect stable legal and economic frameworks, however if these demands interfere too much with their activities and leads to irresponsible lobbying and scrutiny in terms of accountability. \n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.3 Government choice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.3 Government choice\n\nStudy Activity\nSo governments have a choice in where they position themselves.   \nDo you think that the government is:\nPro business?\nFairness to workers?\nFairness to consumers?\nHow to balance these aspects?\nInterventionist or laissez faire?\nCan you think of any examples of each of these different choices that the government has to make?  Make a list of examples.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\n\nThe main ethical consideration arising from this situation is twofold as identified above:\nlegitimacy of business influence;\naccountability (Crane et al.,, 2019)\nBusinesses look to influence to government or public policy through legitimacy of business influences through corporate political activity and they do this through activities such as lobbying, political advertising, financial contributions, legal action and political campaigning.  \nYou will hear in the news how business have paid for government campaigns or have funded political parties in ways to lobby the government. \nFor example one of top Tory Party Donors in the UK in 2022 is JCB who donated over £2.5 million whilst Boris Johnson has been in power.  JCB Chairman has access to Boris Johnson’s top team as part of an elite “advisory board” who lobbied for early relaxation of lockdown measures inn 2020 and tax benefits for high net-worth individuals.  Others have been given public appointments or honours through giving donations.  Therefore business can have a significant influence on the implementation and direction of governmental policies. It is therefore no surprise that the issue of ‘public sector ethics has gained enormous momentum (Dobel 2007).\nIn terms of accountability to the public, one may contend that since the government acts as a representative of society’s interests, the public has a right to be informed about governmental decisions with other constituencies (such as business) and be able to determine whether it is acting in its interests or not.  Both parties are able to influence each other, the main concerns for business ethics are where business has influence on government.  There are numerous ways that business can influence government and Oberman (cited in Getz 1997, p59) distinguishes among different ways, using following criteria as to whether it is:\nThis gives different approaches to influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in

bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you

For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems.

5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, the government acts as the representative of citizens, and is expected to define the conditions which business must meet in order to operate, for example:\nWhat environmental laws to follow\nThe level of corporate taxation that organisations need to pay and.\nWhether one large company can merge with another\nThe aim of the government is to be re-elected, not just to serve its citizens and therefore is made up be elected individuals and these individuals have noble aims as they want to be re-elected in the future.  Their interests usually align with business to make business strong which should result in a booming economy, happy people with jobs and them having an income to spend across the community.  However they are also able to influence by competition in terms of education, health and entertainment such as through local authority owned theatres vs commercially owned or charitable theatres. \nThis image gives an outline as the government as a stakeholder of business:\n\n \nFigure 1:  Government as a stakeholder of business (Crane, et al., 2019, p482)\nOn the left-hand side of the image you will see that the government in principle represents an entire community since it is elected by the citizens of a certain town, region, country or even continent.  In this role as the elected representative of citizens’ interests.  This means that they define the conditions for the licence to operate of business as well as restricting and enabling business.  There is some debate about the degree of governmental responsibility for a functioning economy for example such as through laissez-faire vs. forceful role in industrial policy. \nOn the right hand of the image, the government have a self-interest to be re-elected and therefore they are very dependent on business and also compete with business.  In March 2022, the UK government has published significant reform proposals to drive change in competition and consumer law policy with the aim of boosting trade following Brexit.\nIt could be argued that the government has a conflict of interest between creating jobs and regulating business interests.  This image from Crane and Matten (2019) shows some of these relations and conflicts of interest as well as identifying some of the main sources of ethical problems which stem from fiduciary relation to society in general. \nThis shows Society on the right and the Government in the middle who are setting the standards and regulations in the UK to provide a stable environment for businesses to operate within. On the Right and in this stable environment business provides the taxes eg corporation, VAT etc to the government through providing employment and good work leading to growth in the economy.  Through business activities the government reviews how they can protect citizens in society such as through environmental regulations, paternity leave, minimum wage and other employment regulation and interventions.  These are signals from the government that they are looking after citizens and ensuring business protect Society.  However, the government are caught in the middle of conflicting demands in a bipolar situation.\n\nFigure 2:  Government between business and society interests (Crane et al, 2019, p.486)\nTherefore here we can see that business can have significant impact and influence on the implementation of government policies and business influence legitimacy and accountability are questioned.  Business can expect stable legal and economic frameworks, however if these demands interfere too much with their activities and leads to irresponsible lobbying and scrutiny in terms of accountability. \n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.3 Government choice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.3 Government choice\n\nStudy Activity\nSo governments have a choice in where they position themselves.   \nDo you think that the government is:\nPro business?\nFairness to workers?\nFairness to consumers?\nHow to balance these aspects?\nInterventionist or laissez faire?\nCan you think of any examples of each of these different choices that the government has to make?  Make a list of examples.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\n\nThe main ethical consideration arising from this situation is twofold as identified above:\nlegitimacy of business influence;\naccountability (Crane et al.,, 2019)\nBusinesses look to influence to government or public policy through legitimacy of business influences through corporate political activity and they do this through activities such as lobbying, political advertising, financial contributions, legal action and political campaigning.  \nYou will hear in the news how business have paid for government campaigns or have funded political parties in ways to lobby the government. \nFor example one of top Tory Party Donors in the UK in 2022 is JCB who donated over £2.5 million whilst Boris Johnson has been in power.  JCB Chairman has access to Boris Johnson’s top team as part of an elite “advisory board” who lobbied for early relaxation of lockdown measures inn 2020 and tax benefits for high net-worth individuals.  Others have been given public appointments or honours through giving donations.  Therefore business can have a significant influence on the implementation and direction of governmental policies. It is therefore no surprise that the issue of ‘public sector ethics has gained enormous momentum (Dobel 2007).\nIn terms of accountability to the public, one may contend that since the government acts as a representative of society’s interests, the public has a right to be informed about governmental decisions with other constituencies (such as business) and be able to determine whether it is acting in its interests or not.  Both parties are able to influence each other, the main concerns for business ethics are where business has influence on government.  There are numerous ways that business can influence government and Oberman (cited in Getz 1997, p59) distinguishes among different ways, using following criteria as to whether it is:\nThis gives different approaches to influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in 2008-9 as it had so many officials that had worked there from government posts.\nJapan has a tradition known as ‘Amakudari’, which means that Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high profile positions going into private and public sectors.  It means “descent from heaven”.  This example proved that in Japan, many contracts went to 70% of firms with links (no contest) to previous government bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you

They are answerable to government and voters and have a clear social purpose\nPrivate companies are separate bodies.  They may of course take multiple forms, as we see from mergers and acquisitions all the time, but the very term corporation is derived from the Latin corpus which means body.  They are owned by one person, a few people, many people, or even by other corporations in the form of corporate investors etc.  They may be sole traders, owned and managed by one person, or the management may be appointed to run the company on behalf of the shareholders.  They are of course subject to the law of the land, but their duty is to shareholders, and their performance of that duty is dependent on how well they serve their customers. This generates profit, which is the primary purpose.\nWe can all think of public sector bodies, for example, the Job Centre, the local hospital, even the police or army.  Using that latter example, while the army is distinct from the navy or the air force, they are expected to pursue common objectives.  The armed forces collectively are also part of the state, along with all its other constituents, and they are all meant to be pulling in the same direction.  That direction is decided not by the market, but by governments, which are, of course, elected every 5 years, or more frequently at local level.  They have in common that private profit should not be their primary purpose.  However lean or efficient they might be, the profit (or savings made) is recycled elsewhere in the system rather than shared amongst a few owners.\nMost countries in the world operate a 'mixed economy', consisting of for-profit enterprises, and state-owned organisations.  These two parts of the economy are often referred to as the private and public sectors and are calibrated in different proportions in different states.  For example, in Denmark around 35% of jobs are in the public sector, while in South Korea the figure is only 7.6% (OECD, 2015). \nIn the UK, around 28 million people work in the private sector, which is almost 84% of the entire workforce (ONS, 2018).  There are 5.7 million businesses, which range in size from one person operations ('sole traders') to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) which employ from 10-250 people, up to large national and international corporations.  However, an additional 'third' sector also exists, made up of organisations and associations which are both separate from government and motivated by social objectives rather than private profit.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\nv6.2 The Third Sector\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.2 The Third Sector\n\nSo let’s compare third sector organisations (TSOs) with other sectors, using the features we looked at just now. \nThey are independent of the state, although they might get some funding from local or the national government, or they may be contracted by the NHS to do some work.  They are subject to the law as we all are.  But the government cannot (or should not) tell TSOs what to do. \nSo who owns them?\nThe confusing answer is that for the most part, no-one does, and everyone does. \nIf you look at charities, they are generally overseen by a board of what are called trustees.  They are responsible for directing things, and liable if things go wrong, but they don’t usually get paid, and they don’t share in any profit or surplus.  By the way, day to day management and operations are carried out by paid staff.  It’s not all voluntary. \nBusinesses answer to customers, the government to voters, TSOs to a diverse range of stakeholders, who can have a financial interest such as donors, grant givers, consumers (if they have shops, say) or businesses (if they sell services), even people who are about to die and make a bequest.  But they also answer to communities, and above all to the people or cause they serve.  A charity for disabled adults which wins substantial funding, runs efficiently, and employs dozens of staff will still potentially fail if they don’t serve their beneficiaries properly.\nAbove all, TSOs are motivated by this ‘serve’ mentality.  Social aims such as relief of poverty, protecting the environment, widening access to education, promoting healthy lifestyles, etc. They can’t lose money, or they’ll fail, but making a profit is not their purpose.\nThree key words for the constituents of this sector:\nCharity\nSocial Enterprises (recently rebranded Co-op group is our largest in this country), and\nVoluntary Organisations – the thousands of small entities like sports clubs, allotment societies, self-help groups, tenant’s associations and so on.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\n\n“The third sector includes organisations that:\nExist primarily for a social purpose\nAre independent of the state\nRe-invest financial surpluses in their services\nThe boundaries with the public and private sectors are not clear-cut and over time, organisations move across the boundaries.” \nThis is from Mike Hudson’s book Managing Without Profit. \nTraces history of charity (from a Greek word meaning favour, grace, kindness), which he argues goes back to earliest civilisations, whether it’s in Ancient Egypt, where ferries gave free passage to poor people, the Jewish or Muslim traditions of donating a proportion of your income to the needy, or Christian monks establishing the first hospitals here in England. \nIn many ways the first golden era for charity and philanthropy was the 19th Century, when many ‘household name’ charities were first established (Salvation Army, Barnardo’s, the RNLI, RSPCA, the Red Cross).  This continued up to the 1940s, when government (in the war and after) sought to replace many welfare services previously provided by charity.  Since the 1970s this process has been reversed, and the third sector delivers many public sector contracts, and had an income of over £100 bn in 2008.\nHudson points out the contested nature of the sector’s boundaries.  I would disagree with him, for example, that social enterprises form part of the private sector, as they are driven by social purpose and don’t distribute profits privately.\n\n“A useful way to define the third sector (and social economy) is that it comprises organisations where ‘shares’ of social wealth) are allocated to people in proportion to their needs and activities rather than property (private) or political (public) rights.” - A second definition from Ridley-Duff and Bull, 2011: p17\n\nRidley-Duff and Bull take a more wide-ranging, academic, and radical approach.  They highlight the fact that charitable activity predated the existence of the capitalist system, which only became properly established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nThey also point up two tensions within the third sector:\nNon-profit approach based primarily on giving, versus the ‘more than profit’ approach where SEs trade but do good things with their profits.\nSome organisations, most notably but not exclusively co-operatives, are based on principles of democratic control by members. For example a disability charity where the strategy is set by and for its beneficiaries or service users.  Others are run by one group of people for the good of others, with less democratic input from those they serve.\nThey set social purpose as the key definition, but neglect to mention independence explicitly.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.4 So what's a charity?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.4 So what's a charity?\n\nLet’s start with a charity.  Charity legislation in England goes back to 1603, and there are charities which still exist today which go back still further – there’s an alms house in Winchester which has been going since 1132. \nRoyal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) started in 1868.  Their purpose in a nutshell relates to the welfare of blind and partially sighted people, and the prevention of blindness.  Last year they spent over £123m which puts them in just about the top 20 in the UK.  They helped 17,000 people via sight loss advisers, over 60,000 with general advice, 12,000 with welfare advice, provided 20,000 talking books, and campaigned for safer streets, among other things.  They have 1500 employees and 4800 volunteers resulting in a wage bill of about £60m, and it is confirmed that the CEO earns around £150,000.\nSo charities can be big business. \nIn football club terms RNIB is like Everton or West Ham, in high street terms, a White Stuff.\n\nTopic 6\n6.5 Social Enterprises\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.5 Social Enterprises\n\n\nThe difference between social enterprise and charity is that social enterprises get most of their income from trading, but they are still motivated by social impact more than private profit.  And here’s examples of a social enterprise or two. \nLighthouse furniture is in Towieland, Brentwood.  They stop furniture going to landfill and provide low-cost furniture for low-income families so having two social aims.  They have just over 800k turnover, 80 odd employees and volunteers, and dramatic growth as they’ve doubled in size in 5 years.\nQuadrant here in Chelmsford is part of Chelmsford Star Co-operative, which has a £100m (Like a Burnley level) turnover retail co-operative owned by its customers.  They are committed to co-operative principles including democracy (members elect the board) and supporting the local community (equivalent of 20% of profits donated to good causes).\n \nConfusingly social enterprises can be charities too.  Lighthouse is one.  But Chelmsford Star isn’t.\nThere are some statistics below:\nYou can see that charity numbers, at least in E&W are fairly static, social enterprises are growing in number (and that growth is partly reflected in growth in co-ops). \nWe can’t leave this section with introducing food backs which have grown considerably across the UK particularly in 2022 and the cash crisis.  Food banks have seen their donations skyrocket by 5000% a month in 2020 with the average donation of approximately £1900.  The needs for foodbanks has grown across the UK and those that need access to this service can through vetting procedures.  This is an area of social enterprise that has significantly increased over the last few years.\nEton College\n\nEton College is a school in Eton, Berkshire in England and was founded in 1440 by Henry VI.  It has famously been attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, and other senior conservative prime ministers, for example.  However they have designated registered charity status.  Their charitable income includes fees, as these are raised in support of their purpose: education. \nThe fees are  £12,354 per term and therefore should they be a charity? \nFees, then generated £42m for the school and it has 646 employees and NO volunteers.  During the year 277 boys (21%) received fee reductions; 70 of these boys paid no fees at all. The equivalent figures for the previous year were 277 and 64. the amount spent on fee remission increased from £5,773k to £6,084k with the average award remaining 64% of the full fee.  It has £300m of assets, mainly property and investments.\nIn comparison, the Royal National Lifebook Institution (RNLI) is one of the biggest charities in the UK.  They are funded through donations, grants, legacies and account for £174m of its income of £192m.  It has 2200 employees and 33,000 volunteers.  It has saved 329 lives and helped 42,000 people in 2019.\nWhy should a charity do this?\nIs there any reason why the same could not apply to government bodies too? \nCSOs have a tradition of campaigning for legal reform, and against unfair policies or laws.  However, there are strict limits on charities, for example, campaigning for a particular party in an election\nHere are some ways in which CSOs take on this role:\nIndirect action often takes the form of research, communications, information, raising awareness about activities which are not seen as ethical.  So for example, an anti-obesity charity would campaign in the media and social media against fast food or soft drinks companies, as part of its general work. \nDirect action is riskier, can be violent (unlikely) or non-violent in nature.  If violent it is more likely to be property than people who get damaged.  But a group called SHAC (NOT registered charity) attacked Huntingdon Life Sciences with threats, violence and vandalism. They only stopped in 2014, after 15 years.  More often it’s like we see here with the Greenpeace boat in an earlier lesson.  However some of the ways they can cause disruption is through demonstrations, marches, letters, occupations, and boycotts.\nBoycotts are a form of ethical consumption, and organised refusal to buy services or goods.  So they:\nChange a policy\nGet a buzz around or against a company more generally\nCommunicate disapproval\nOr punish the company in their pockets\nIs this always a negative?  Can it be good for companies in the long run?\nCSOs or TSOs can challenge government as well as business. \nAnd of course the government can regulate and control business and TSOs in return.  However business complain of red tape, and charities find some of these regulations as e over burdensome such as having to report requirements attached to funding.  They also support and enable TSOs to thrive and here are some of the things being ‘traded’ between government and the sector. \nThe government is committed to tackling obesity, and charities exist with the same agenda.  They may not always agree, but some policy will chime with TSO campaigns. \nThe government can also provide a legislative framework broadly supportive of TSOs, which TSOs can support back.  If the government promotes volunteering, TSOs and CSOs can host events through providing volunteers.  This helps the government meet its own objectives (and maybe save money?)\nFinancially, in various ways: through buying their services; granting funds for projects or research; and lending, perhaps via social finance (more in a minute) .  In return, public trust (charities trusted more than govt, still), agility, flexibility, social innovation, access to ‘hard to reach’ people.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.6 Government Policy \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.6 Government Policy \n\nThe government launched Big Society Capital (BSC) in April 2012. Its purpose is to provide wholesale funding (investments, repayable) for charities and social enterprises to grow in scale, use as working capital, and buy assets to generate income.  Started with £120m, made up of ‘sorry money’ from UK banks, and money from dormant bank accounts.  By 2015, over 250 charities and social enterprise had accessed finance (from intermediaries) that BSC provided, which resulted in a total of £195m, of which BSC accounted for £68m from its own cash.\nThe conservative government proposed the Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support Bill) in 2021 and is currently passing through parliament.  This bill was to assess the benefits and effectiveness of TSOs and provide to support organisation’s function.    You can read more about this proposed bill here - Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support) Bill (parliament.uk)Links to an external site.. \nThe National Citizen Service (NCS) encourages socially meaningful volunteering and participation by young people.  Piloted by a social enterprise with 100 odd people in 2009, the government adopted it in 2010 and since then over 200,000 have signed up.  Clearly has an impact on the third sector.  It was mainly set up to encourage 16–17-year-olds to volunteer during the summer after their GCSEs.  \nThe conservative government introduced the “big society” plan in 2010 to empower communities, however it was ill-fated and was disbanded mainly due to the fact that it lacked funding and support.   The government now wants people to have a say at local level in terms of getting better facilities using a cross sector approach which is not just up to local government.  However for the social sector there is no big new pot of money and the total spend due to austerity measures has been in significant decline and many community projects have been abandoned. \nThe government launched the Social Value Act which came into force in 2013 with aim of ensuring wider social, economic and environmental benefits.  This allowed the government to ensure that contracts would be awarded to organisations where their social values could be evaluated, and the government departments would then report on the social impact of these contracts.  The Social Value Model provides a consistent approach for the departments to streamline and standardise the procurement process. \nLet’s now think about how business interacts more positively with CSOs.  Here are some ways.\n\nFigure 3:  How Business interacts with CSOs.\nOn the right of this image are some of the ‘paybacks’ the third sector can offer for these interactions such as through joint ventures and the sense of ‘exchange’ is greater and more formalised in the bottom half of this image. \nWe’re familiar with the great entrepreneurs and giving.  \nCarnegie was a captain of industry or robber baron depending on your viewpoint, made a fortune in steel in the 19th century in the US, sold out for $480 million, which is $310 billion today.  One of the richest men who ever lived, gave $350 million away.   He killed strikers in his steel plants and was responsible for the worst manmade disaster in US history at the South Fork Dam.  However, he built 3000 libraries, a university and his final $30 million was donated in his will to institutions, charities and pensioners.  \nHow do we place this along with modern individual figures like Gates and Zuckerberg in the context of business ethics? \nMore recently, an expectation is that companies themselves ‘give something back’.  For example, a firm has an office in Chelmsford, where its Foundation is also based.  It had profits in 2018 of £121m and it spent less than £1m on the foundation, although technically they don’t have to give it.  A further example is Omaze which is a fundraising platform which has enabled over 300 charities to raise over £100m.  They give back by doing world-changing work such as creating after school programmes for 17,000 children in Los Angeles or through raising funds for disaster relive in California fires.   Each year the entire organisation takes a break from their office jobs for an annual day of service where they volunteer with a local non-profit organisation and give back to the community.  Organisations in the UK are also doing this, and they reward their staff for community based voluntary activities.\nWhere would this fit in ethical theories? \nVery much a teleological approach – there is a purpose behind it.  You could say it was egotistical – the company doing good for its own purposes.   Hasn’t even been completely demonstrated that (e.g.) profits are linked to CSR.  So why bother? It can help with long term revenues, reduced costs, managing risk and uncertainty and maintaining the social licence to operate.\nCompanies who are seen as socially responsible might attract more customers, and irresponsible ones are likely to lose them, and their employees might be more productive.  For example, a focus on sustainability leads to reduced costs by saving energy or cutting down on waste and acting responsibly, and being perceived to do so, can reduce government interventions, and potentially prevent bad practice and associated costs.  Also it allows the company to operate, and potentially contributes to a stable, peaceful, and equitable environment in which to do so. \n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.7 Activity 1 – What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.7 What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\n\nDiscussion Activity - Contribute to the discussion\nThird sector and charitable organisations such as food banks have grown through Covid and current cash crisis in the UK.  Many governments funded projects are short-term and output focussed which fails to meet the needs or support citizens and communities and therefore sustainability is key for these organisations.\nThinking about your own experience of third sector organisations or through research how do you think Third Sector organisations can diversify their income, work more agile and work more with government policymakers to improve the lives of people in crisis?\nPost your comments  to the forum and respond to one of your peer’s posts.\n\nTopic 6\nReply\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n28 May 20:59| Last reply 30 May 9:07\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nDiversifying Income and Building Sustainability in the Third Sector\nThe growth of third sector and charitable organisations such as food banks during COVID-19 and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis reflects a deep and increasing need for community-based support systems. However, their heavy reliance on short-term, output-focused government funding undermines long-term impact and sustainability. From both research and experience, there are several ways in which these organisations can become more financially resilient, agile, and influential in policymaking:\n1. Diversifying Income Streams\nTo reduce reliance on time-limited public grants, third sector organisations can:\nDevelop social enterprises: Many charities are setting up business arms that offer goods or services while reinvesting profits into their core mission. For example, The Trussell Trust has partnered with retailers and tech firms to run donation-linked campaigns.\nCorporate partnerships: Strategic, values-aligned partnerships with private companies can provide long-term income and resource sharing.\nIndividual giving and legacy donations: Investment in digital fundraising platforms and awareness campaigns has helped some charities significantly grow their donation base.\nReference: NCVO (2023) highlights that charities with diverse income sources were more financially stable during the pandemic.\n(Source: National Council for Voluntary Organisations – www.ncvo.org.uk)\n2. Becoming More Agile\nAgility is key in responding to crises. This includes:\nInvesting in digital infrastructure: Enabling remote support services, managing data more effectively, and enhancing communication.\nCollaborative working models: Pooling resources with other third sector groups or local authorities to avoid duplication and increase efficiency.\nUpskilling volunteers and staff: So they can adapt quickly to changing demands and service needs.\n3. Working With Government Policymakers\nThird sector organisations must play a more active role in influencing social policy:\nData-driven advocacy: Charities often hold unique frontline data about poverty, food insecurity, and housing. Sharing this with policymakers can shape better-targeted interventions.\nInclusion in long-term planning: Instead of being seen as emergency responders, charities should be embedded in local and national resilience strategies.\nDemonstrating outcomes: Providing robust evidence of impact, beyond output metrics, helps justify sustained investment and policy support.\nConclusion\nFor the third sector to continue meeting rising community needs, especially during economic hardship, it must move towards income diversification, operational agility, and proactive policy engagement. Only then can it provide sustainable, long-term support to the most vulnerable.\nReference; \nNational Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO, 2023).\nThey provide insights and data on how UK charities managed through COVID-19 and economic uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of income diversification for financial sustainability.\nCitation:\nNCVO.

However, one of the biggest challenges is that many of these organisations rely on short-term or project-based government funding, which often limits their long-term impact and planning.\nTo move forward, I believe third sector organisations must shift their focus towards resilience and long-term capacity-building, rather than just reacting to crises.\nOne way to strengthen their stability is by building community-led income models. This means not only accepting donations but involving local communities in creating solutions — like community cafés, repair shops, or thrift stores — that generate income while serving a social purpose. These types of micro-initiatives empower people locally and reduce dependency on external funding.\nAnother approach is for these organisations to build stronger alliances with local authorities and other nonprofits. Often, many organisations work in the same area but separately. By collaborating more closely and sharing resources like office space, training, or volunteers, they can reduce costs and strengthen service delivery.\nIn terms of policy influence, the third sector should use evidence and data from the people they serve to push for policy change. Many smaller charities don’t realise how valuable their on-the-ground insights are. By submitting reports, joining local policy networks, and attending public consultations, they can make sure the voices of those in crisis are heard at government level.\nFinally, third sector organisations should invest in staff development and digital skills. Many charities still struggle with technology and rely heavily on a small number of staff or volunteers. Training staff in digital tools, fundraising strategy, and public advocacy can make the organisation more confident and effective in any situation.\nReferences\nNCVO. (2022). Civil Society Almanac.

Many people rely on these organisations for basic needs, such as food and shelter. However, one of the biggest challenges they face is sustainability, especially when their funding depends on short-term government projects.\nTo make third sector organisations more sustainable, I believe they should focus on three key areas: diversifying income, working more flexibly, and partnering with government policymakers.\nFirst, to diversify income, charities can go beyond traditional donations and apply models like social enterprise, where they sell goods or services to fund their main goals. Many also benefit from corporate partnerships, local fundraising, grants, and even online subscriptions. For example, some food banks now partner with local grocery stores to collect regular food donations.\nSecond, these organisations should work more agilely. That means using digital tools, responding faster to local needs, and reducing red tape. For example, during the pandemic, many local charities used WhatsApp and Zoom to coordinate services quickly. Using flexible systems also helps them adapt when funding or community needs change suddenly.\nFinally, it is essential that third sector organisations have a voice in public policy. Instead of just reacting to crises, they should be part of the conversation when new social policies are being created. This can be done through research, case studies, or involving people with lived experience in meetings with government officials. Building these relationships can lead to long-term solutions, not just emergency aid.\nIf third sector organisations can build more reliable income, adapt faster, and be part of shaping policy, they will not only survive but grow stronger in the long run.\nReferences\nMacmillan, R.

Most of these organisations depend on brief projects for funding which sometimes prevents them from having a lasting effect. As a result, organizations in the third sector should increase their funding, adapt work practices and regularly engage with policy experts. A good way to increase income is to blend public money, social business, campaigns for raising funds, partnering with companies and digital giving. Crowdfunding and teaming up with supermarkets have been key to The Trussell Trust in supporting their food banks for years (The Trussell Trust, 2021). Thanks to digitalisation, charities can serve more people and raise more money. It is also very important to be agile. Hence, governmental processes should be updated by replacing strict structures with agile systems that emphasise making decisions fast, more use of technology and greater service closeness to citizens (Macmillan, 2020). The use of agile strategies helps third sector organisations respond quickly to the changing needs of their communities. Partnership with government officials helps achieve significant changes in a business. Together with service users, some organisations now work with policymakers to design new solutions to poverty and exclusion (Clark et al., 2022).\nAll in all, sustainability for the third sector over the long term is achieved when organisations have varied incomes, can adapt to changes and influence public policy through working jointly.\nSources\nClark, J., Kane, D., Wilding, K. & Bass, P.

Diversity\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.1 The business case for Diversity\n\nMaking a business case for diversity has provided justification to organisations for best practices and how it can drive progress and improve companies bottom line.  The links between diversity and financial improvement has strengthened over the last few years and organisations that have incorporated “social listening” of their employee online reviews shows the importance of inclusion and why companies should pay attention to diversity on moral grounds of fairness and equal opportunity.  However the report from Orgiane Georgea and Aneeta Rattan in June 2022, outlined why organisations should stop making the business case for diversity as they found that this approach makes underrepresented job candidates less interested to work with an organisation and it undermines Diversity and Inclusion effort.  The authors suggested that a ”fairness” case is more effective and is based on “moral grounds”.  Through their research they found that 80% of organisations used the business case to justify diversity with less than 5% using the fairness case.  They also found that:\n“Our statistically robust findings show that underrepresented participants who read a business case for diversity on average anticipated feeling 11% less sense of belonging to the company, were 16% more concerned that they would be stereotyped at the company, and were 10% more concerned that the company would view them as interchangeable with other members of their identity group, compared to those who read a fairness case.”\nUltimately the business case for diversity can have negative impacts on underrepresented groups as it can undermine diversity efforts and therefore a fairness case is more effective. \n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\nv7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\n\nReports have identified that Women and BAME communities are under-represented in full-time work and leadership roles across UK organisations who need to explore wider talent pools to draw candidates from throughout the community and understanding diverse markets and clients.  One example in 2020 was Marks and Spencer who reviewed its workforce and identified that it needed to reflect a truly diverse and inclusive environment through its employment practices, its retailing practices including ranges it carries and its store layouts and as a business with stores in the communities.  Marks and Spencer had a large population of retail assistants who were white females and they identified that they needed to more reflective to represent their diverse customer base through recruiting, retaining diverse talent through setting targets for ethnic minorities and women in management.\nAnother initiative across organisations has been to increase the number of women into executive roles at Board level.  During 2021 40% of UK FTSE 100 board positions were held by women compared with 12.5% just over 10 years ago.  (Gov.uk, 2022).  Having a diverse workforce can generate higher profits and even a 10% increase in women in organisation has been linked to 3% in increase in profits.\nThe government has introduced legislation in the form of Gender pay Gap reporting for organisations with over 250 employees who have to report annually on their gender pay gap with the aim of helping reduce the gap between what women and men are paid.  Some organisations have set targets to reduce this imbalance with a large construction company setting targets to increase the number of women they employ to earning over £40,000 a year to at least 25% by 2025.  Visit the equality and human rights act and read the Closing the Gender Pay Gap report. \nTraditionally the typical family model has been the women as care giver providing care for the children and being employed in part-time roles, allowing them to work around childcare for example with the man being the breadwinner going out to work.  Many leaders in organisations have been white strong men.  Thinking about governments we have seen only one black leader in the USA and two women prime ministers in the UK, which does not represent our diverse communities.\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n7.3 So what are the solutions?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.3 So what are the solutions?\n\nOne of the solutions is to introduce Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging Programmes.  Organisations such as the UK Supreme Court have created diversity, inclusion and belonging strategies to help them reflect the society we live in and to respect the differences and supporting equal opportunity for everyone.  This means doing the right thing and that every member of staff within the court feels they belong through contributing their views which will be valued.   \nYou can read more about their strategy as - https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/uksc-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-strategy-2021.pdfLinks to an external site. \nSome of the ways that organisations can introduce these programmes is to ensure that they attract, recruit and develop diverse talent and work with under-represented groups to retain diverse workforce.  Development of inclusive leaders is important, and organisations need to ensure these have the skills, confidence and behaviours to build positive relations that enables all employees to thrive.  Through people analytics and data collection relating to diversity will help understand and develop aspects of diversity in the workplace.  By being an employer of choice and taking action to be inclusive, supportive and respectful will ensure that employees wellbeing matters and it is a brilliant experience for all.  Finally organisations that support accessibility for all in promoting education and outreach work will promote themselves to others. \n\nTopic 7\n7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\n\nEqual opportunities legislation is generally targeted at ensuring procedural justice is promoted and it prohibits discrimination against ANYONE.  However Affirmative Action programmes on the other hand, deliberately attempt to advance groups under-represented in the workforce through redistributive, or retributive justice.\nOrganisations need to ensure that they have fair:\nRecruitment policies\njob criteria\nTraining programmes for discriminated groups\npromotion procedures to senior positions for discriminated groups\nDiscrimination as the solution to discrimination?  Positive discrimination is generally unlawful in the UK for example where an employer wants to recruit a person specifically based on their protected characteristics such as Race for example.  However the previous Met Police Chief Cressida Dick asked for the law to be changed so that their recruitment processes could favour ethnic minority candidates over white applications as currently the force does not represent the community and nearly 8000 complaints of racism have been received.  The Met Police want to recruit a diverse workforce that represents their community; however this may mean they are not selecting the best candidates and having  targets to recruit higher ethnic participation is good may mean accepting lower standards.\n\nTopic 7\n7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \n\nIndividuals are living longer than previously with life expectancy for example in the UK which has increased from about 72 in the 1960s to 81.2 years in 2019.  This means that individuals are likely to work longer and therefore organisations need to review the opportunities for the older generation.  Thinking about some job roles, how realistic that someone in their 70s can be an active firefighter or prison warden?  Therefore organisations need to think about different job roles and how individuals can manage their work and expectancy.  Individuals will be less likely to be able to retire at 65 as they may not have the required savings to provide a reasonable income and research has suggested that many individuals currently in their mid-40s may need to work into their early to mid-70s to cover this financial shortfall. \nThis image from Gratton and Scott (2017) study shows some of the changes for example historically individuals went to school, work and then retired.  However now they have multistages of life, they go to school they may work as an employee, or they may look to mix this with self-employment or even have a portfolio of work which is paid and unpaid which they may take into retirement.  Therefore organisations need to consider how they can change corporate policies and HR policies and practices to support healthy and prosperous longevity.\n\nFigure 1:  Changing Ideas of Wellbeing at/about Work (Gratton & Scott, 2017)\nThe world has changed and how we are introduced to different “generations” in society.  Generations is the sociological notion of being born across a span of about 20 years, for example:\nGen Z (zoomers) born mid to late 1990s to early 2010\nGen Y (millennials) born between 1981 and 1994/6\nGen X born between 1965 and 1981\nBaby boomers born between 1945 and 1964\nThe literature is clear, the statistical differences across most measures on common work issues/styles is so small that more research should be focusing on generational similarities and not differences.   Each of these different generations may exist at the same time and therefore how do organisations build gaps between the way they work and communicate?   Gen X tend to have values of ambition and strong ability to work hard where Gen Y are competitive in an extremely advanced world.  Gen Z grew up with tablets and smartphones and digital experiences are crucial to their DNA.  They are able to multi-task be independent and can be demanding in the workplace and if they are not engaged, they will leave.\nSo what can an employer do to improve its working practices covering these generational differences? \nEmployers need to develop wellbeing policies and procedures to ensure that employees are engaged and thrive through reduced stress, anger and health problems.  The relationship between engagement and wellbeing is vital because when people experience work influences their lives outside work and overall wellbeing influence their lives at work.\nGallup have produced a report which identified that wellbeing is crucial for business.  You can read it here:  https://www.gallup.com/workplace/313067/employees-aren-thriving-business-struggling.aspxLinks to an external site.. \nThe report was based on positive psychology, and it identified 34 themes based on the fact that the individual spends approximately 81,396 hours at work.  Organisations now report their employee engagement to customers, and they suggested that those not thriving in their lives are more vulnerable and add risk to the organisation in terms of burnout and stress.   They also identified that 52% of workers who were thriving had less missed absence and struggling employees had higher levels of depression and anxiety resulting in big differences in productivity.  The latest 2022 report identified that global engagement was still low and employee stress was at a new all-time high with over 44% of employees experiencing daily stress.  The report also identified that the best places in the world to be an employee were the US And Candidate with being the No1s for living comfortably, employee engagement, job opportunities and second for wellbeing.\nHow can organisations improve wellbeing?\nPerkbox in 2020, identified the following different ways that an organisation can improve employee wellbeing:\nProvide employee assistance programme\nHelp employees work towards long-term goals\nSet friendly fitness challenges\nIntroduce wellbeing-based employee benefits\nArrange regular get-togethers\nIntroduce designated wellbeing leaders\nEncourage real breaks\nCreate a comfortable work environment\nReward and recognise great work\nEncourage staff to take responsibility for their own wellbeing\nConsider offering unlimited holidays\nCreate stronger employee-manager relationships\nArrange wellbeing workshops\nMake it easy for your staff to make healthy choices\nTweak the working routine to work for staff\nSurvey teams to find out which of the wellbeing initiatives are working\nThinking about our own organisation which of these initiatives do they offer and how effective do you think they are?\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762188-20564-Topic_8_.docx ---\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. The business of business is business’.\n‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’.\n\nHowever, only human beings have moral responsibility for their actions; corporations aren’t human beings, despite the name and the sense of being a body.  Doing otherwise than acting for shareholders was for him a betrayal and theft from shareholders’ dividends.\nTherefore, as long as business complies with society’s laws and regulations for business, their only responsibility is to act in the best interest of shareholders and businesses aren’t elected, and managers aren’t trained to decide what’s in society’s best interests.\nFriedman was part of the Chicago School of Economics, associated with monetarist policy, reduction in public spending. Arguably, with his ideological opponent JM Keynes, the most influential economist of the 20th century.  This article is ‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’ and if you look on Canvas you can read it in full.  It was an essay published over 50 years ago in (1970) and took issue with what he saw as a distressing trend among corporations to worry about social responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.

responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.2 Corporate Social Responsibility\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.2 Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCSR has become the widely accepted term for when companies have a “corporate internal decision structure which directs decisions in line with predetermined goals” – strategy (French 1979) and that organisations “manifest a set of beliefs and values that lay out what is generally regarded as right or wrong in the corporation”  organizational culture (Moore 1999).  There is a sense that they are entities which can have a social impact, and that therefore this should be positive as far as possible and hence CSR is a worldwide phenomenon, above all though in the US.\n‘Semantics aside, if corporations are to formulate and implement strategies in turbulent environments, theories of strategy must have concepts, such as the wide sense of stakeholder, which allows the analysis of all external forces and pressures whether they are friendly or hostile.’  Edward Freeman (1984)\n“Corporate social responsibility is concerned with the ways in which an organization exceeds the minimum obligations to stakeholders specified through regulation and corporate governance” (Johnson and Scholes, 2002, p. 247)\nIn 2008, Banerjee put forward the moral and logical case for CSR in that:\nCorporations are powerful social actors that cause social problems and produce social goods\nCorporations should think beyond making money\nCorporations should behave in an ethical manner\nCorporations should be involved with the community they operate within\nThey can not escape their responsibilities and they must pay attention to social and environmental issues.  Organisations must demonstrate a high level of integrity and transparency across their organisations and use sustainable resources for the greater good.  They should also enhance social welfare for providing community support through philanthropy and other means. \nCarroll’s CSR pyramid is a framework for explaining how and why organisations should take social responsibility and highlights four of the most important types of responsibility for organisation:\nEconomic responsibility\nLegal responsibility\nEthical responsibility\nPhilanthropic responsibility\n\nFigure 1:  Carroll’s CSR Pyramid (ResearchGate, 2022).\nEconomic responsibility is the foundation of the pyramid and structure and is fundamental to survive in business and profitability and compliance with the law are important for social responsibility through producing goods and services that society needs at a fair price with employees who do their jobs safely and fairly.\nLegal responsibility relates to compliance with the law such as minimum wage for example across both national and local regulations.  It also regulates behaving as company citizens, meeting legal obligations through supplying goods and services that meet minimum legal requirements.\nEthical responsibility relates to embracing activities in an ethical manner and consistent with society’s expectations and respecting evolving and ethical standards that are adopted by society.  It also reflects preventing infringement of ethical standards and acknowledging that business integrity and ethical behaviour go beyond compliance with laws and regulations. \nPhilanthropic responsibility relates to voluntary and discretionary activities and practices of business such as giving back to the community through volunteer work.\nIn 1991, Donna Wood identified different approaches to Corporate Social Performance in terms of:\nHaving social policies - explicit statements of company values, goals; and social targets; emission / recycling targets.\nLeading to social programs - Activities and instruments to measure achievements of social policies.\nWith measurable social impacts - Concrete changes the corporation has achieved towards its CSR policies; although it can be difficult to measure – ‘soft’, qualitative data\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/258977.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab2fdd8176c1e350c1c53247f5931f875Links to an external site.\nWe have seen in earlier lessons how the UN is supporting global change.  Through the Global Compact campaign the UN has enacted 10 ethical principles for long – term success.  The image below shows the 10 different principles:\n\nFigure 2:  UN 10 Ethical Principles - https://www.atlantica.com/web/en/sustainability/united-nations-global-compact-ungc/Links to an external site.\nThese principles are not legally binding or mandatory or enforced but reflect the way they should be working.  It has been suggested that the Global Compact is “bluewashing” which refers to the fact that few companies are actually complying with these principles.    Bluewashing is bad because consumers tend to think that companies are more ethical and socially responsible than they are as they use their membership of Global Compact as an easy way out.  Bluewashing is focussing on human rights and labour conditions and where companies are required to submit reports.  Between 2005-2013 many thousands of companies did not comply.  Companies have said they prefer voluntary codes of conduct.\nIn addition to Bluewashing there is “greenwashing”.   This means, a strategy where companies over-emphasise positive aspects of their environmental records to mask their actual performance’ (Marquis & Qian, 2013). “At the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, a group of NGOs held a Greenwash Academy Awards event to criticize companies that falsely promote themselves as environmentally responsible and to “recognize these companies for what they are: hypocrites.” (Lyon and Maxwell, 2006, p.4) \nHere are some examples of Greenwashing in action:\n‘BP Going Green’ and ‘Beyond Petroleum’…\nThis was a multi-million-dollar advertising campaigns where they were promoting commitment to alternative energy sources.\n‘Shifting from oil to energy companies’ and they suggested ‘From the Earth to the Sun, and everything in between’ and were awarded ‘Golden Paintbrush’ by Greenpeace in 2008\nGlobal Financial Crisis where BP shut its alternative energy HQ and Shell stopped investing in wind / solar.\nSince then there has been some progress due to shareholder pressures.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.3 CSR Choices: Shareholders and Stakeholders \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.3 CSR Choices: Shareholders and Stakeholders \n\nCorporate social responsibility depends on whether ethical behaviour is rewarded, and/or unethical behaviour is punished or the legitimacy of the stakeholders’ claims.  This means that the leaders’ values are important, and pressures are placed on leaders to act ethically and not unethically.   For example, when stakeholders needs and goals clash, then the most powerful tend to win.\nThis is problematic because CSR a ‘northern’ / developed world phenomenon and  the ‘Ideas developed in New York, not Sao Paolo’.  This means that power and influence of customers  in developed countries is greater than workers in developing countries and the interests of customers in developed countries are  different to interests of workers in developing countries,  CSR programs directives of ‘west’ and companies’ choses CSR goals, employees have to follow. \n\nFigure 3:  Stakeholder Map\nIf there is conflict is there a business case for CSR?  Can organisations really show causation between CSR and profits?  Good corporate citizenship can be related to good financial performance in terms of brand reputation and be attractive to prospective and current employees and we have seen earlier poor examples such as Primark where poor practice impacted their brand.   \nThe image below shows how the firms’ actions and financial returns influence primary stakeholders and society:\n\nFigure 4:  Mapping the business cases\nThe dotted line at the lowest part of the image shows how a firms actions link directly to financial returns and therefore shareholders take actions to remain viable.  The positive signs show how stakeholder theory reflects on firms’ financial returns which are enhanced through actions that improve the relationship with its primary stakeholder.   The dashed line at the top represents the complicated link between firms’ actions and financial returns with society.   Therefore the better the firms’ actions to better society but does it impact financial viability? \nThis article explains this in more detail and gives some good examples as to the conflict between society and stakeholders - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0007650316660044Links to an external site.  The business Case for CSR:  A critique and an indirect path forward, Barnett, 2016.\nIt could be argued that the freedom to engage in entrepreneurial activities is in itself socially responsible and can bring many benefits to society including jobs, training and revenue for suppliers.  We have seen poor practices from companies where they have dumped waste into the oceans, or their production processes pollute the air.  Apart from affecting the local community this could also impact the employees and put them at risk, increasing absence, reducing productivity and may result in fines which will negatively impact the profits and therefore the shareholders.   In 2018, a study by McKinsey found that the top quartile of companies which promoted ethnic and cultural diversity within their executive teams were 33% more likely to lead profitable companies.  Shareholders expect return on investment and companies are looking at ways they can support the communities through offering training to young people who might not have the best education and although there are costs to the shareholders of this, in the longer term the trainees become more productive and profits increase.\nSuccessful CSR\nLego if an example of great practices when it comes to CSR and sustainability.  Lego is renowned for being one of the most reputable companies in the world and not just through helping children develop through creative play but through fostering a healthier planet.  The World Wildlife Fund Climate Savers Partners named Lego in terms of its pledge to reduce its carbon footprint.  The only toy company to be named. \nBy 2030 Lego plans to use only environmentally friendly materials to produce its core products and packaging and one way that is has done this was through shrinking the box sizes by 14% in 2013 and 2014, saving approximately 7000 tons of cardboard.  They moved away from producing the blocks using petroleum-based plastic and has committed to remove all single use plastic packing from its materials by 2025. \nIn addition it has invested $164 million into a sustainable materials centre where researchers are experimenting with different bio-based materials which Lego can implement into the production process.  This is a really good example of how businesses can be socially responsible but also result in increased the profits which almost doubled between 2012 and 2015 and have increased by mover 5 million dollars between 2016 and 2021.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.4 The End of CSR?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.4 The End of CSR?\n\nIn 2012 Peter Fleming wrote about the ‘end of corporate social responsibility’ and he argued that most CSR-related activity was motivated by profit, not principles and CSR was an ideological practice that extended exploitative and colonising agenda of the corporation.\nThe article identified that damage inflicted by global firms is systematic rather than piecemeal.  They also identified gigatrends which are likely to affect the future of humanity such climate change, energy depletion, rise of BRIC nations, the genome revolution and over-population of megactivities located in the southern hemisphere. \nFleming and Jones have argued that actually large corporations tend to act only in the interests of a small number of stakeholders (e.g., their senior managers and equity holders) and therefore lack the ability to deliver outcomes that are beneficial to society as a whole.    Therefore, it could be argued that actually CSR is not about reducing the business effects on society but more a public relations strategy designed to convince governments and employees that they can still do good and make money at the same time.  Brennan argued that CSR is a “parasite” (Brennan, on wider social movements and was really more about the response to damage caused by global corporations.  Large corporates in the past have exploited workers in developing countries and are now exploiting the situation they have caused to the economic advantage to their most powerful stakeholders.  \nCompanies such as Allbirds or Sweetgreen are companies that are building social responsibility as a cornerstone to their business rather than companies that are trying to effectuate the change.  The public today is holding business leaders to account and trust in government is in decline across the UK and USA in particular.  Millennials and Gen-Z are driving this change and exert influences on organisations through purchasing power. \nIs CSR just propaganda designed to cover up parasitic corporate behaviour?\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.5 Activity 1 – Sustainability and Responsible Business

unit and from some research, I understand that responsible business means a company should not only focus on making profit, but also think about how its actions affect people, the environment, and future generations. Sustainability is about using resources wisely so that we don’t harm the planet and can continue to live well in the future.\nMain Global and Business Issues:\nClimate change – causing floods, droughts, and extreme weather that affect farming, homes, and businesses.\nPollution – from factories, cars, and plastic waste, harming air, water, animals, and human health.\nOveruse of natural resources – such as oil, water, and forests, leading to shortages and high costs.\nInequality – some businesses pay low wages or use child labor, which creates poverty.\nWaste management – businesses producing too much waste that ends up in landfills or oceans.\nHow These Issues Started Over Time:\nIn the past, businesses focused only on profit and growth, with little care for th\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762296-20564-topic_9_.docx ---\n9.1 Social enterprise and entrepreneurs?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.1 Social enterprise & entrepreneurs?\n\nA social enterprise is an independent business which is autonomous of the state and government control and set up to help the severely disadvantaged.  For example Jamie Oliver created “fifteen” which is the name of restaurants founded by the Chef to create employment for the severely disadvantaged.\nSocial entrepreneurs are those that work to improve social issues through business whilst generating profit for shareholders.  For example, Bill Drayton is a social entrepreneur and founded Ashoka:  Innovators for the Public in 1980 which looks to find and support social entrepreneurs globally.  He set out to alter existing patterns of activity and vetting and electing social entrepreneurs with unique qualities. \nLatest figures suggest there are over 100K social enterprises in the UK and they have been set up to deal with major problems such as helping overcome child poverty, drop in wages, rising house prices, pollution levels across 40 towns and cities in the UK along with obesity. \nSocial enterprises have flourished due to the failure of existing institutions to solve them through welfare state which was designed to support full, full-time employment or through bureaucracy in terms of slow, costly and dehumanising processes.  Therefore there was a need for a new approach to solving these problems.    Social enterprises get their income mainly from trading in goods and services from fast-moving, evolving environment in comparison to charities that get their income from grants and donations and existing in a more stable and slow moving environment.,    However there are some grey areas in terms of charities as social enterprises.\nThey have characteristics that enable them to transform systems and practices through being innovative, market orientated and driven to system change.  They are good at setting a mission and strong communicators being able to tell the story that focuses on the social good of the product.  They are also visionary and alliance builders and can communicate their aims in moral terms and happy to take help from wherever they can.\nSo where does social enterprise fit it?  Have a look at this image from Clearly So, 2015.\n\nFigure 1:  Where does social enterprise fit?\n\nSocial enterprises operate using different types of business model:\nFee for Service Model:\n\nFigure 2:  Fee for Service model\nIn this model the beneficiary pays for the services for a fee eg Fair for You which is a lender offering an alternative to loan sharks.  The income comes from the interest people pay directly in exchange for the service.  Legally, a charity is the sole owner of the lending company, which can gift profits to the charity.\n\nSubsidization Model:\n\nFigure 3:  Subsidization Model\nHere, the beneficiaries get stuff cheaper or free, and consumers pay for the benefits.  For example TOMS – sells shoes. For each pair sold, another is given to someone in need.  Does a lot more too…\nOf course it may be that the trading just pays for a service to be given away, not just identical products.\n\nEmployment (Social Firm Model):\n\nFigure 4:  Employment (Social Firm Model)\nSocial firms aim to employ people from disadvantaged groups.  They trade to consumers, but people in them get work, dignity, self-respect, or training.  Harry Specters’ mission is to ‘offer confidence and hope to young people with autism by providing employment and free training, enabling them to produce great products, such as our award-winning chocolates. In doing so, we aim to be a role model for “great product, great cause” for other businesses, individuals and entrepreneurs.’\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\nv9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\n\nSome of the social enterprise goals are driven by not profit or shareholder value but through setting their own high standards.  Social enterprises have missions to support and serve social or ethical issues and needs through directly being involved in the production of services.  Social enterprises create jobs and operate by setting a standard of ethics to service the society and one of the key differences is that social enterprises are less concerned with paying owners and stakeholders but more concerned with serving their societal mission.\n\nHere are some examples of social enterprise goals:\n‘Getting something from nothing’ through un-/Under-used physical, social, financial capital or through putting them to use satisfying some unmet social need(s); and by delivering outputs more efficiently than public or private sectors.\nForming long-term relationships that develop over time by outlining how it is Not about providing a service to clients nor is it about short-term profit; but it is about Long-term social return and Inclusivity by creating a sense of membership / belonging and recognising unique, distinct / different needs of users.\nInnovation and creativity:  through design / deliver new approaches to pressing problems and combine approaches from public and private sector bodies and experimenting the ‘R&D wing of the welfare system’ by creating a portfolio of solutions to issues.\nBeing ethical in terms of Britain’s top 5 co-operatives pay more tax than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks; Pay fair wages to 2,000,000 employees; and Do the greatest good possible: 28% of Social Enterprises work in poorest communities (only 12% of SMEs)\nBe successful with more social enterprises generated a profit last year than private, Growth rate of ‘responsible’ brands nearly double that of ‘conventional’ brands; Judged as ‘fairer, more diverse, and serve customers to a higher standard’ than public / private.  Demonstrate their social impact to stakeholders which is Difficult, not impossible.\nHowever Social Enterprises have started working with large corporations to drive impact together.  Through COVID-19 and climate change the private sector has been transformed and has provided corporate leaders with the opportunity to focus on their social responsibilities.  An example of this is when COVID-19 hit and a group of 85 foundations, corporations and intermediaries came together to create the World Economic Forum’s COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs.  Through social procurement strategies the group was able to provide mutually beneficial outcomes for corporations and social enterprises.   Large organisations such as Ikea and Unilever were already adopters of souring from social enterprises and with the support of Ikea Social Entrepreneurship has published the first corporate report on social enterprises.   You can read more about this report here:  How Corporations and Social Enterprises do business together to drive impact – Available at: Acumen | Corporate ReadyLinks to an external site.\nOn of the key changes to employment practices, driven by COVID-19 has been the gig-economy.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\n\nYou were introduced to Uber and the Gig Economy in an earlier lesson but here we will develop this further in terms of how it is changing the world of work.  Uberization has been defined as “fragmented work” where workers are offered small individual pieces of work which the worker can choose to accept or not.  Typically this is offered through apps that is used by both consumers and workers as an interface with little or no intermediatory.  This can have advantages for the worker in that it provides flexibility, greater independence, variety of work and pay.  However there are also disadvantages in the fact that they are not paid benefits such as sick pay, maternity leave or career progression and sometimes find it difficult to switch off. \nFrom a business perspective there are advantages as it lowers costs and gives them flexibility to adapt to scale as workers are not locked into contracts and therefore there is less regulation.  However there are usually high turnover of workers who tend to be less qualified or reliable workers and can lead to poor public perception of the organisation.\nHowever those working in Crowd working can be through global platforms who are looking for highly skilled workers:\n\nFigure 5:  Crowd working and Gig Work\nCrowd employment is a new form of employment that still uses online platform to enable organisations or individuals to solve problems or provide services in exchange for payment eg outsourcing of tasks to pool of online workers rather than single employee.  The work is based on individual tasks rather than continuous work.  Crowd working has been replaced with the term “platform work”.\nThe platform economy has brought benefits in creating jobs but for the individual it usually means they end up working for more than one platform for poor pay resulting in poor working conditions and being unable to financially survive.    Gig work is growing at a rapid rate with the sector more than doubling in size since 2016 with more than 7.25 million workers in the UK in 2022.  Part of this is due to technology and apps to sell their labour but also Covid-19 has had a massive impact in terms of how we work.    Platform economy is eg UberEats or Glovo for example and offers workers per gig basis.  A gig worker sells their skills through a platform and are usually locally based. \nPlatform work is remote and is mainly through providing digital services such as data entry or programming on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr which acts as an auction house for human labour, where individuals bid for work.  Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in lower-wage countries and it has been suggested that the office faces a future like that of the factory floor where work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. \nSadly those that work in the gig economy are no longer protected by a legal system that was designed for a different age as they are defined by workers.  Workers have minimum wage and trade union rights protected as well as paid holiday entitlements.  Only “employees” are entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payment, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal.  Gig-economy firms assume their workers to be self-employed and fight trade union such as the Independent Workers’ Union  of GB who claim otherwise.\nIt is estimated that the number of gig workers is constantly on the increase and the figure employed in this type of work is anticipated to surpass 90 million by 2028.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to keep gig workers as part of their future workforce.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\n\nOne of the other factors influencing the changing world of work is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and how they will impact the creation of new jobs.  The image below shows how these are interrelated:\n\nFigure 6:  AI or Machine Learning (Coinsight.com)\nArtificial intelligence is a computer-based design system to think the way human intelligence does and means more than doing specific tasks like Alexa who responds to your voice.  AI has the ability to make decisions and it learns from data science to create something new.  It has been used to tackle problems such as testing drug compounds for curing cancer.   AI can be used to monitor customer tracking on websites or changing traffic patterns.  Amazon Go uses AI algorithms to create unmanned convenience stores that monitor your shopping experience and charge you automatically when you walk out the door.  For example up to 400 cameras in the store monitor your interactions to charge you appropriately. \nIn contrast machine and deep learning are algorithms which do one task really well eg analysing data over time and therefore are only as good as the data flowing through the system.  Alexa runs machine learning software where the price goes up or down based on your personal information, the email that gets filtered to your inbox or chat boxes that respond when you ask questions.\nCompanies are using deep learning models and AI to stay competitive through using behavioural biometrics or language processes to improve customer service and IT management.  Therefore, data scientists and machine learning engineers are in high demand and managers and organisation need to “manage” these AI processes similarly to how they would manage people as they are a resource.  This can also include “robots” and “robotics” which means development of a new set of skills in the workplace.  AI and machine learning are going to change the way we work but they are not likely to make human workers obsolete for an awfully long time.  Automated tasks are likely to be replaced by AI but it will also drive innovation to create many new sectors for growth resulting in more wider job creation. \nHowever a recent TUC report on AI has identified the ways that AI could lead to discrimination and is calling for urgent legal reform in this area.  One recent example is how Linkedin for example has been pushing “cleaning” adverts to women only.   The case of UberLyft in the Dutch courts held the dismissal by machine as unlawful and how under GDPR automated decision making is prohibited.  The TUC have asked for an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide a right not to be discriminated against or subject to detriment for the processing of inaccurate data or through making all those in the \"value chain” jointly liable for discriminatory AI.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.5 Modern Slavery\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.5 Modern Slavery\n\nDue to the expansion of globalization, one of the outcomes of this has resulted in modern slavery where people are forced to work through threat, or they become owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical abuse, they become dehumanized through being treated as a resource, their freedom is restrained or they are exploited through underpayment (Crane, 2013b).\nRead through the Ethics in Act 7.2 from the text book and reflect on how modern slavery is impacting employees at work.\n\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.6 The Employment Relationship\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.6 The Employment Relationship\n\nEmployees are managed by the HR department and the term Human Resource Management has subject to debate as it implies humans are the resource and usually the most costly resource within an organisation.  Employees have various rights at work such as to respect their employer which is based on a general understanding of human rights and employment law.  The employee also has duties in terms of completing the work based on their contract within wider employment laws.   For example, an employee has the right to freedom from discrimination or to privacy or to health and safety working conditions.  They have duties to comply with their contract, with the law and respect the employers property.   Many organisations have comprehensive diversity, equality and inclusion policies to promote best working practices and engage staff across the organisation.  We have seen earlier sections of this course examples from Marks and Spencer and the MET police in the UK and how they are trying to attract a more diverse workforce.  We have also looked at women in senior posts and gender pay gap reporting and this is still a problem with discrimination practices being demonstrated through the recruitment and selection process and even recent cases such as Asda have highlighted the differences in pay between women and men carrying out like work.\nEmployees are entitled to privacy and control the information about themselves.  \nThere are four types of privacy:\nPhysical – surveillance cameras in private rest areas would compromise physical privacy\nSocial – freedom to behave in our private life as we so choose – however if it brings the organisation into “disrepute” then actions could be taken\nInformational – how, when and to what extent private data about others can be released and breaches eg employees social media can be monitored by organisations if it brings the organisation into disrepute\nPsychological – controlling emotional outburst and not being forced to share private thoughts and feels eg making employees smile and appear happy in front of customers.\nDepending on the organisation and industry, some employers carry out routine health and drug testing of their employees and this has been contested as an issue of business ethics.  The problem is that employees feel that the tests are taken too often and take more information than the employer actually needs and therefore does the test do more harm than good? \nTracking of emails has been common for sometime as well as checking what the employee downloads to their PC and has resulted in dismissals where company information has been leaked or when inappropriate materials have been downloaded.\nSurveillance cameras have become significant in recent years and many offices use these to protect employees and employers and there are many examples of where employees have been caught “red” handed when committing crimes or demonstrating inappropriate behaviours across the workplace.  With Covid-19 and hybrid, home working, the use of surveillance has increased and is currently under debate.  Some of the banks have adopted “key board” tracking surveillance so they can tell when their employees are typing, some are accessing the employees webcam to see when they “move” from their seat and it could be argued this is an infringement of privacy and it is interesting to see how this will develop over the next few years and how employment law/cases will introduce controls in this area.\nHow do you think surveillance will develop in the next five years? \nHow do you feel about this level of surveillance in your home when home working and how would handle this if your employer said this was mandatory from the 1st January next year?\nMake some notes and reflect on these ethical areas of change in the workplace.\n\nTopic

challenging the gig economy can be for drivers and other workers. Many of them work under zero-hour or flexible contracts, which give them freedom but don’t offer proper protections like sick pay, holiday pay, or job security. This creates a situation where workers have high risks but fewer rights.\nFor example, in the UK, Uber drivers have gone on strike several times over low pay, poor working conditions, and lack of rights. One important event was the UK Supreme Court ruling that Uber drivers should be treated as workers, not just self-employed, giving them access to basic rights. Also, the deal between Uber and the GMB union was a big step toward improving representation for drivers, allowing them to raise concerns and negotiate better conditions.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nOffer Minimum Protections: Even if workers are on flexible contracts, employers should give basic benefits like minimum wage, sick leave, and holiday pay.\nClear Contracts: Companies should give workers clear information about their rights, responsibilities, and how their pay is calculated.\nAllow Union Support: Like the Uber-GMB deal, gig workers should have access to unions or worker groups to protect their rights and raise their voices.\nUse Technology Fairly: Companies that use apps to manage workers (like Uber) must ensure the systems are fair, transparent, and not exploitative.\nListen to Workers: Regular feedback and communication with workers can help identify problems and improve working conditions.\nConclusion: The gig economy is growing, but companies must find a balance between flexibility and fairness. Giving workers more rights and protections doesn’t just help them—it also improves company reputation and worker satisfaction in the long run.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:08| Last reply 30 May 8:57\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the articles, it’s clear that Uber’s business model has come under a lot of pressure due to how it treats its drivers. The strikes, pay disputes, and legal challenges show that gig workers often face unstable incomes and limited rights. While Uber has made some progress—like its agreement with the GMB union to give 70,000 drivers minimum wage, holiday pay, and pensions—there’s still more to be done.\nIn the gig economy, many workers are classed as self-employed, which means they miss out on basic protections. To change this, employers should move toward offering more secure contracts that include benefits like sick pay, regular working hours, and protection against unfair dismissal. They should also be more open to working with unions, like GMB, and give workers a voice in decision-making. Fair algorithms and transparent policies on pay and work allocation are also key.\nUltimately, gig work can offer flexibility, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of basic rights. Companies need to take more responsibility for the people powering their platforms.\nTo improve the situation:\nGive workers fair contracts\nOffer sick pay and holiday pay\nBe clear about how pay is decided\nUse fair systems to give out work\nListen to workers and work with unions\nMake sure workers have legal rights\nExpand discussion thread from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf AlmheiriReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n26 May 23:28| Last reply 30 May 8:57\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nAfter reading the articles, it’s clear that Uber has had a complicated relationship with its drivers in the UK. The gig economy has brought a lot of flexibility to workers, but it also comes with big downsides especially when it comes to job security, pay, and basic rights.\nIn the Bloomberg article, we see concerns over a fuel shortage and a possible union strike, which shows just how fragile the situation can be for gig workers. The Employee Benefits article highlights that drivers are striking over pay, showing that many of them don’t feel fairly treated. But there are also signs of progress. The GMB Union deal article shows that 70,000 Uber drivers in the UK now have union representation, which is a huge step forward. And the Supreme Court ruling confirms that Uber drivers are workers not independent contractors which means they’re entitled to benefits like minimum wage and holiday pay.\nThese developments show that employers can make changes when there’s enough pressure from workers, the public, or legal systems.\nTo improve the situation, companies in the gig economy should:\n•Offer clearer contracts that reflect the reality of the work and provide fair terms.\n•Guarantee a minimum wage, so workers know they’ll earn enough to live on.\n•Provide benefits like sick pay, holiday pay, and pension contributions.\n•Allow union representation so workers have a voice.\n•Be transparent about how pay is calculated and how decisions are made (like deactivations).\nUltimately, flexibility shouldn’t come at the cost of fairness. Gig economy companies can still be profitable while treating their workers with dignity and respect.\nExpand discussion thread from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al AhbabiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nHatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n23 May 17:36| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nReply from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nThe case of Uber in the UK highlights the growing debate around how companies in the gig economy treat their workers. While platforms like Uber have created jobs for many, they have also raised concerns about job security, pay fairness, and workers’ rights.\nFrom the articles, one of the biggest turning points was the UK Supreme Court’s decision in 2021 that Uber drivers should be classified as “workers” rather than independent contractors (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This gave them legal rights to minimum wage and holiday pay, which was a big win for gig workers in the UK.\nLater, Uber made a historic agreement with GMB Union, giving about 70,000 drivers in the UK the right to union representation (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). While this was praised by many, the situation remains tense. Uber drivers have continued to strike, arguing that pay levels are still too low and conditions are not fully fair (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.).\nThese events show that legal victories alone are not enough — real change needs to happen in the way gig workers are treated daily.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve Gig Work Conditions:\nRedefine What “Gig Work” Means: Employers should stop hiding behind the label of “self-employed” just to avoid giving benefits. If the company controls working hours, pricing, and performance like Uber does then the worker should have rights just like an employee.\nCreate Fair Pay Standards: Gig companies should provide a clear minimum pay guarantee per hour, including waiting time. Drivers often spend time online without rides, which affects their real earnings.\nGive Gig Workers a Voice: Companies should regularly meet with driver representatives and unions to discuss policies and pay. Uber’s deal with GMB was a strong start, but more engagement is needed to fix ongoing disputes.\nBuild Flexibility with Protection: Flexibility is one reason why people join the gig economy  but it should not come at the cost of basic protections. Employers should offer opt-in insurance, sick pay schemes, and support services.\nInvest in Worker Wellbeing: Companies like Uber depend on their drivers, but often offer little support during crises like fuel shortages or pandemics. Offering fuel discounts, mental health resources, and fair cancellation policies can build trust and reduce worker stress.\nConclusion\nThe Uber case shows that responsibility and flexibility can go together. While the company has taken some steps to support its drivers, the ongoing strikes and dissatisfaction suggest that more honest, fair, and balanced systems are needed. The gig economy will only be sustainable if workers are treated as essential partners not disposable service providers.\nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n23 May 17:34| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nAfter reading the articles about Uber and its drivers in the UK, it’s clear that the gig economy has created a lot of flexibility — but also many challenges for workers. Drivers often work long hours without stable income, benefits, or job security. The Uber case is a great example of how limited protection through self-employment contracts has raised serious concerns.\nIn the past, Uber classified its drivers as independent contractors. This meant they had no access to minimum wage, holiday pay, sick leave, or pensions. The situation reached a turning point when the UK Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that Uber drivers should be treated as \"workers\", not just self-employed freelancers (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This decision was historic because it forced Uber to rethink its contracts and give drivers more legal protection.\nSince then, Uber signed a union agreement with GMB, giving 70,000 UK drivers access to representation, which was a big step forward (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). Still, challenges remain. According to recent reports, drivers have gone on strike over pay and working conditions, especially during the UK fuel crisis (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.). Many feel the changes haven’t gone far enough.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nFair Contracts: Employers like Uber should move away from using zero-hour or purely self-employed contracts for core roles. If workers rely on the job for regular income, they should receive protections like minimum wage and sick leave.\nWorker Representation: Giving gig workers access to independent unions and allowing them to raise issues safely is essential. Uber’s agreement with GMB is a positive example, but more companies need to follow this model.\nTransparent Pay and Conditions: Companies should clearly explain how drivers or gig workers are paid, including how rates are set and what deductions apply. Hidden fees and unclear commissions create stress and reduce trust.\nSupport for Health and Wellbeing: Gig workers often work long hours with few breaks. Employers can offer support like insurance, access to counselling, or even discounts on fuel and maintenance.\nTechnology Transparency: Many drivers rely on apps to get work, but these systems often control how much they earn or whether they stay on the platform. Workers should have more input into how these systems work and appeal unfair deactivations.\nConclusion:\nThe Uber case shows that change is possible when workers stand up and the law supports them. But more still needs to be done to make the gig economy fair and sustainable. Employers need to take responsibility — not just for profits, but for the people who power their platforms.\nReferences\nADCU. (2021). Supreme Court Landmark Victory Over Uber.

The clashes Uber has faced in the UK highlight the rising disagreements between new technology and workers’ legal rights. By calling Uber drivers employees, the 2021 decision by the UK Supreme Court redefined what employers must and should provide (Supreme Court, 2021). Employers have many solutions they can implement. Formulating rules that protect the hours worked, benefits received and end of employment can give workers a foundation of dignity in the workplace (ILO, 2021). Let’s also ensure that both workers and management work together for solutions. Whilst that agreement shows progress, Uber should now let drivers contribute to pay discussions and work environment (GMB, 2022). Also, websites must work on becoming more transparent. It is important that everyone can review the algorithms that distribute jobs and salaries, to prevent being exploited. In addition, governments and businesses should together establish rules that list platform workers in different categories with suitable perks. The most ethical approach is for people to have the flexibility they want while still earning fair wages. Following this, companies should rewrite their contracts, help workers unify and put people’s wellbeing first.\nReferences\nGMB. (2022). Uber and GMB Strike Historic Deal.

Pandemic > 10.2 Ethical procurement or corporate gravy train?\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying and the giving of contracts during COVID-19 in an early lesson, however during the pandemic the UK government spent £56m on private consultants during the pandemic, at rates of up to £14,000 per day, without giving other companies a chance to compete. \nSixteen private consultancy firms, including major companies like Deloitte, PWC, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey have been working at the heart of the government’s response to the virus and it is suggested that they have made deals with Tory party donors/members worth up to £526 m: P14 Medical; Meller Designs; Globus (Shetland)  They have been rapidly hired to work on the track and trace system, the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the search to produce working ventilators.\nAmong the contracts given to McKinsey, whose consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks’ work – £14,000 a day - to createLinks to an external site. a permanent replacement for Public Health England, helping define its “vision, purpose and narrative”.\nThere is discussion of a close relationship which centred around horse racing between Dido Harding and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, where P14 medical had ten employees and is owned by a Tory Councillor.  Meller’s owner gave £60k to party, Shetland has given £400k for special access to PM etc. as part of the ‘Leader’s Group’. \nAlso, the National Audit Office has carried out a review in terms of regarding the contracting of PPE during the crisis, which was apparently agreed without going through the official process. \nDuring the pandemic, AHRC-funded research has studied questions relating to legal and ethical perspectives and responsiveness within health and social care in the government.  These studies have related to COVID--19 related fraud, public sector procurement and use of management of data by the public sector such as through vaccine development, uptake and delivery.   The University of Bristol have completed a specific study focusing on fraud during the pandemic and whether the rules for criminalizing fraud is fit for purpose.  The research highlighted the need for reform of current practices and that prosecutorial guidance needed to be produced to minimize the role of conspiracy to defraud.  Overall, there needs to be greater transparency in terms of data relating to conspiracy to defraud with suggestions that publication of disaggregated charging figures be used. \nThere are a lot of lessons to be learned from the pandemic in terms of tightening up the governance in organisations to improve processes and business continuity plans through supply chains and sourcing strategies which are redesigned to focus on resilience rather than focusing on lowest price. \nIs this just an amplification of the existing cosy relationship between governments of whatever party, and corporates?\n\nTopic 10\nPrevious\nNext\n10.3 Sustainable post-COVID future?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 10 – Business Ethics in the Pandemic > 10.3 Sustainable post-COVID future?\n\nFollowing COVID-19 the high street is in decline due to the increase in online shopping resulting in a loss of jobs and has created more precarious work for gig economy workers.  Also private landlords have continued to benefit due to contracts to ensure no evictions resulting in a gap between wealthier professionals and those who have to work face to face.    Following COVID-19 and the removal of all restrictions some employers are forcing their workers back to the office which is resulting in the great resignation which reflects how employees are reviewing their work life balance and looking for employees that can offer fully home working or hybrid working.  This is a good article to read which relates to CSR and COVID-19:  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joms.12642Links to an external site..\nFollowing COVID, it has been identified that organisations need to be able to react more rapidly and be more agile and responsive to the needs of policy makers and citizens.   One of the most urgent needs is to build a persuasive knowledge society which is informed by integrated and trustworthy science to develop the knowledge to respond to today’s challenges.  However access to knowledge creation and dissemination needs to be equitable to leading to the three pillars of sustainable development reviewed in an earlier week.  The world we live in needs to be more interconnected and there needs to be solutions designed through open and inclusive sciences through the support of all governments.  International collaboration, engaging with knowledge partners and fostering networks of mutual learning can help problem solve across the world.\nThere is suggestion of a need for more public and private partnerships to engage in the sustainability agenda to enable this rapid response and throughout COVID-19 the private sector contributed most to research activities and were able to share data or make their technology platforms available for track and trace for example.\nOne of the key trends following COVID-19 is how organisations adapt to the new world through for example home/hybrid working.  Some organisations have closed their large offices in large cities in the UK and have moved to fully remove working or a hybrid model with hot desking and employees coming into smaller shared spaces at least once a week.  Flexible working and home working has intensified throughout the pandemic, and it now remains should be return to onsite work?  With organisations that have 100% productivity what is the need to go back to their offices and how will this make it better?  Some employees have refused to return to the workplace, and this is something organisations need to consider.  Organisations need to consider a portfolio-based approach to work in terms of using multiple options such as automation, gig talent, alliances and through outsourcing activities.  Organisations will need to restructure, and they will need to ensure that their employees have the right skills to defuse risk, optimise costs and develop needed capabilities.  Companies that will thrive post COVID will be those that have the right mix of flexibility and resilience.\nMatt Symonds, one of the Co-founders of Fortuna Admissions has suggested there are seven ways to make business truly sustainable post COVID.\nSeven Ways to Make Business Truly Sustainable Post-COVID (forbes.com)Links to an external site.\nThese are:\nFlattening the curve – in terms of for example, demand for health care systems or through the demand for utilities through managing interrelated systems and AI to help individuals respond to market conditions\nEngage with the local community at a grass roots level – going beyond emissions for example and really working with diverse communities through organisations seeing local community as their partners in achieving human security, sustainability and resilience.\nRealise the global impact of your actions – rethink production, trade and consumption models in sufficiency instead of continued growth\nEmpower employees to make them happier and more productive – changes to management thinking and trust to make people happy and productive through remove working by empowering employees. Organisations need to develop trusting relationships characterised by supportive leadership, mutual support and shared commitment.\nDon’t “go it alone” to solve difficult problems – the pandemic has shown that organisations need to pool together their resources to find ways to tackle major challenges and therefore collaboration bring together inter-disciplinary experts who have insight to identify solutions. Having inclusive and productive culture which is underpinned by revised reward systems and promotion partners leads to embedded partnerships.\nDon’t make profit your sole priority – organisations should act responsibly by paying their taxes as opposed to trying to avoid these (as seen in earlier lessons. Organisations that have a “just in time” operational practices and associate this with their financial strategies links to the profit maximizing thing to do. \nEmbrace “green capitalism” – should we revisit the model of capitalism as COVID has shown how shareholder capitalism in the form of cooperative with stakeholders and shareholders is good business.\nHow effective do you think these practices will be post COVID and are there any other practices that you think organisations should consider in the future?\nPost COVID Supply Chain Sustainability Trends\nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis we have seen vulnerabilities to the supply chain and therefore transformational change needs to take place so that in future supply chains are not as significantly affected and trade can still happen.\nOne of the ways this can happen is through increased supply chain transparency.  Due to lockdowns and reduced working, global supply chains were damaged throughout COVID-19 and organisations need to review the resilience of these in future to increase business sustainability.  One of the ways this can happen is through increased technology and digital maps (or digital twins) of their supply chains.  Digital maps contain all the relevant information on an organisation’s suppliers, their sites, any products at risk and enables them to conduct scenario analysis to inform contingency plans.   These maps will help organisations make vital decisions without having to scramble for unorganised data or rely on one or two suppliers during times of change. \nThe Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures provides recommendations on how organisations can assess their own risks and present opportunities for improvements through climate change through innovation of new products and services to create wider range of procurement channels that mitigate risk and drive supplier competition.\nOne of the key trends following COVID is the importance of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in terms of people from vulnerable communities and how they are being exploited through environmental practices.  Organisations need to review their supply chains to make sure they are inclusive and sustainable to move society forwards.\nOrganisations need to consider the reduction with suppliers they have direct as well as indirect contact with.  Most organisations deal with suppliers who then deal with other suppliers in the chain.  The organisation may use the supplier for their ethical and sustainable practices, but how does it view the practices of those two or three layers into the supply chain that they have no direct contact with?  This is interesting and something organisations need to consider in the future.  They may have no contractual relationship with these lower suppliers, but their ethical practices may impact and influence their ethical and sustainability polices. \nOrganisations need to revisit the social agenda and the disadvantaged and marginalised across the communities and what they need to do to drive diversity, inclusion and fairer human rights through meeting the needs of various stakeholders.  Technology is advancing at such a range that it is increasing the privacy and human rights agenda as we have seen in previous weeks of this unit.  There is growing importance for organisation to align new technologies with human right principles.  Organisations need to consider their “executive compensation” packages for retiring or removal of executives.  The community are conscious of these unfair practices and it is clear that large payoffs for corrupt senior executives is no longer ethical or good sustainable business practice.\nHealth and wellbeing are growing areas for organisations through the pandemic but also for organisations to focus more on the long-term physical goals of their employees.  Organisations are investing in programmes such as meditation, yoga and relaxation classes or supporting employees through paid gym membership fees as they have identified that investing in the long-term health of their employees provides benefits to the organisation through better customer services and employee engagement and productivity.\n\nTopic 10\nPrevious\nNext\n10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 10 – Business Ethics in the Pandemic > 10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\n\nDiscussion Activity -

Environment/Sustainability\nPositive Effects: During lockdowns, air and water pollution levels dropped due to reduced travel and industrial activity. For example, cities experienced clearer skies and cleaner rivers.\nNegative Effects: These improvements were temporary. As activities resumed, pollution levels rebounded. Additionally, the pandemic led to a surge in medical waste, like disposable masks and gloves, which increased environmental pollution.\nConclusion: The pandemic showed that environmental improvements are possible but require sustained efforts beyond temporary shutdowns.\n2. Globalisation\nDisruptions: COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages of goods and highlighting the risks of over-reliance on international trade.\nShifts: Some countries began focusing more on local production and reducing dependence on global suppliers.\nConclusion: While globalisation faced challenges, it adapted rather than reversed. The pandemic emphasized the need for more resilient and diversified supply chains.\n3. Stakeholders\nCommunication Changes: With restrictions on gatherings, businesses and organizations shifted to online platforms to engage with stakeholders.\nChallenges: Virtual interactions couldn't fully replace the benefits of in-person meetings, leading to difficulties in building trust and collaboration.\nConclusion: The pandemic accelerated digital engagement but also highlighted the importance of personal connections in stakeholder relationships.\n4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nIncreased Focus: Companies placed greater emphasis on CSR, supporting communities through donations, adapting operations to produce essential goods, and ensuring employee well-being.\nStrategic Integration: CSR became more integrated into core business strategies, reflecting a shift towards long-term sustainability and social responsibility.\nConclusion: The pandemic reinforced the importance of CSR, showing that ethical practices can align with business success.\n5. Third Sector (Charities and Nonprofits)\nAdaptation: Many organizations quickly adapted by moving services online and finding new ways to support communities.\nFinancial Strain: Despite increased demand for services, many faced funding challenges due to economic downturns.\nConclusion: The third sector demonstrated resilience and innovation but requires ongoing support to sustain its vital role in society.\nOverall Reflection: The impacts of COVID-19 confirm many theoretical approaches discussed in the module. They highlight the interconnectedness of global systems, the importance of sustainable practices, and the need for ethical responsibility across all sectors. These insights will be valuable for the upcoming assignment.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:29| Last edited 29 May 6:30| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nEnvironment:\nCOVID caused a short drop in emissions.\nIt showed the need for greener, long-term practices.\nImpact: Boost in eco-friendly tech and digital supply chains.\nExample: DHL used digital mapping to cut emissions and improve delivery efficiency.\nGlobalisation:\nThe pandemic disrupted global supply chains.\nCompanies are now going more local and flexible.\nImpact: Less reliance on overseas suppliers.\nExample: UK supermarkets sourced more local produce due to import delays.\nStakeholders:\nMany workers faced health risks and poor treatment.\nTrust in employers dropped during the crisis.\nImpact: More focus on employee safety and rights.\nExample: Amazon workers protested over unsafe working conditions.\nCSR:\nSome companies helped, others acted selfishly.\nCSR was tested during the pandemic.\nImpact: Increased pressure for genuine, people-first actions.\nExample: Pret offered NHS workers free drinks and discounts.\nThird Sector:\nCharities faced more demand but limited funding.\nShort-term support wasn’t enough.\nImpact: Need for long-term partnerships and stability.\nExample: UK food banks saw usage soar while struggling to meet needs.\nConclusion:\nCOVID revealed ethical and operational weaknesses.\nIt confirmed the need for responsible, fair business.\nImpact: Push for sustainability, fairness, and stakeholder trust.\nExample: Many businesses now include well-being in their long-term goals.\nExpand discussion thread from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf AlmheiriReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAbdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n23 May 12:19| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\nReply from Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n \nEnvironment & Sustainability\nImpact:\nTemporary environmental improvements during lockdowns (e.g. reduced air pollution).\nRise in plastic and medical waste post-pandemic.\nTheory: Confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve – economic shifts affect environmental outcomes.\nExample: Global drop in emissions during 2020, followed by rebound due to recovery activities\n Globalisation\nImpact:\nDisrupted global supply chains led to regionalisation.\nEmphasis on supply chain resilience and local sourcing.\nTheory: Supports “glocalization” – global framework with local execution.\nExample: Firms reshoring manufacturing to reduce dependency\nStakeholders\nImpact:\nShift to digital stakeholder engagement; highlighted the digital divide.\nTheory: Partially challenges Stakeholder Theory – virtual tools aren’t always inclusive.\nExample: Limited access in remote areas affected community involvement\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nImpact:\nCompanies with strong CSR showed higher resilience.\nCSR efforts expanded to include public health and community aid.\nTheory: Supports Business Case for CSR – social responsibility strengthens long-term success.\nExample: CSR-linked firms had better stock performance.\nReference: ScienceDirect (2024)\n\nThird Sector (NGOs/Nonprofits)\nImpact:\nFaced funding cuts, but adapted with innovation and digital solutions.\nTheory: Confirms Resource Dependence Theory – success depends on adaptability.\nExample: Virtual fundraising and partnerships increased\n \nReferences ;\nScienceDirect (2024).

I examined the correlation between each point and theoretical frameworks, as well as whether actual occurrences corroborate or contest such concepts.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nLockdowns resulted in diminished pollutant levels owing to decreased transportation and industrial operations. Conversely, plastic waste has grown due to masks, takeout packaging, and medical supplies. Additionally, several enterprises postponed their sustainability objectives owing to fiscal pressures.\nExample: In 2020, cities like as London had improved air quality during lockdowns, although encountered increased waste from personal protective equipment (PPE).\nTheory: This somewhat undermines sustainability theory, which anticipates long-term advancement. The COVID-19 pandemic shown that advancements might be impeded during crises.\nGlobalisation\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the interconnectedness of the global community. When one nation ceased operations, others were impacted as well. Supply networks were disrupted, trade diminished, and travel ceased. Numerous enterprises began seeking local suppliers to mitigate potential hazards.\nExample: UK supermarkets saw shortages due to the inability of international suppliers to deliver.\nTheory: This validates globalization theory, demonstrating that international commerce amplifies risks during global crises.\nStakeholders\nThe outbreak affected employees, consumers, vendors, and local communities. Some corporations stressed employee wellness, while others focused only on simple survival. Employee welfare and job security surfaced as prominent issues.\nExample: Companies like Morrisons offered monetary incentives to employees, whilst others enacted layoffs.\nTheory: This validates stakeholder theory, which posits that corporations must consider all stakeholders, not alone profit.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nMany companies escalated their initiatives during the crisis. They allocated funds, aided critical personnel, or endorsed the NHS. Some employed their resources to aid the public instead of only selling products.\nExample: McDonald’s provided complimentary lunches to NHS personnel, while BrewDog manufactured hand sanitizers.\nTheory: This substantiates CSR theory, demonstrating that ethical behavior is crucial, particularly during a crisis.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-Profits)\nCharities had considerable difficulties during the COVID-19 epidemic. Events were canceled and contributions decreased. Concurrently, a growing population requires support with nutrition, shelter, and mental health.\nExample: The Trussell Trust, a food bank organization, experienced a significant increase in individuals need food assistance.\nTheory: This undermines the notion that the third sector can consistently bridge the gap; they require additional support and investment during crises.\nFinal Notes for Assignment: COVID-19 confirmed many theories about business responsibility and ethics, but it also showed weaknesses, especially in sustainability and the third sector. These notes will help me explain how theory meets real life in my assignment.\n \n \nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n19 May 13:10| Last reply 23 May 9:26\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Business and Society\nI learned a lot from the courses and my own study. I realized that COVID-19 had a huge influence on many parts of business and society. Here are the effects I've found, along with real-life examples and how they fit with theory.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nThe situation got better in certain aspects at the start of COVID-19. There were fewer automobiles and flights, which meant less pollution in the air. But as time went on, more trash was made, mostly from masks, gloves, and take-out boxes. A lot of businesses also put their aspirations to go green on hold so they could focus on staying alive.\nThis goes against sustainability philosophy since it indicates that when circumstances are tough, environmental ideals aren't always the most important thing.\nGlobalisation\nThe epidemic made it very hard for trade to happen over the world. Because to manufacturing and border closures, a lot of firms couldn't receive the goods they needed. Ford and Toyota, for example, had to cease making cars because they didn't have enough parts. To reduce future danger, several businesses are increasingly choosing local suppliers.\nThis backs up the thesis of globalization by showing how interrelated countries are and how a problem in one location may affect the whole world.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 had an effect on workers, consumers, suppliers, and communities. A lot of people lost their employment or had to work from home. Health and safety were more essential. Some companies did a good job of taking care of their employees (such Tesco awarding bonuses), while others were criticized for not doing enough.\nThis backs up stakeholder theory, which claims that businesses should care for all of their stakeholders, not just their shareholders.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nA lot of businesses started doing more to aid the neighborhood. BrewDog, for instance, provided hand sanitizer, and grocery stores opened early for NHS personnel and seniors. During the crisis, some businesses really cared.\nThis backs up CSR theory by showing that companies can be responsible, even when things are rough.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-profits)\nDuring the epidemic, it was challenging for charities. There were fewer donations and events were canceled. But people wanted their aid more. Food banks like The Trussell Trust, for instance, witnessed a huge rise in the number of individuals who needed help.\nThis goes against some ideas in the third sector since it revealed how hard it is for charities to get by when they don't have enough money.\nConclusion\nThe pandemic showed that business is not just about profit. It confirmed that companies have responsibilities to the environment, people, and society. At the same time, it also showed that in a crisis, some of these responsibilities can be pushed aside. These insights help me better understand how theory applies to real-world situations.\nExpand discussion thread from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n19 May 0:35| Last reply 19 May 8:41\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nAlyazia Ayed Al Ahbabi\nID: 2447614\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Key Areas\n1.

However, these gains were temporary; Less than two years after the pandemic began, emissions had returned to the levels seen before the outbreak, solidifying Blowfield’s (2013) view that many programs for environmental sustainability address surface-level issues without fundamentally transforming systems. The pandemic also paused corporate climate action, exposing a tension between environmental ambition and short-term financial survival. This challenges the optimistic premise in Carroll's Corporate Social Performance model that sustainability is always included in strategic planning. As argued by Blowfield, it confirms the requirement for transformational, as opposed to incremental change.\nGlobalization\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed how vulnerable the world’s supply networks have become, causing major shortages of essential goods. Griffin argued that rising levels of globalization significantly enhance systemic risk, which came to light during the pandemic. Many major companies reassessed the way they source and manufacture goods, prioritizing local and regional production. This question, the ‘globalization at all costs’ perspective emphasized in earlier CSR and stakeholder theories, encourages a risk-sensitive and resilient approach to globalization. Carroll's view that business corporations operate in a tightly linked global stakeholder ecosystem continues to hold, but COVID-19 illustrates that excessive reliance on global interdependence undermines resilience.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 has rewritten stakeholder priorities. Employees' health and well-being were on the radar, highlighting companies' social responsibility beyond profit margins. Amazon was beset by global protests against unsafe working conditions at warehouses, while Microsoft and Salesforce enhanced remote work benefits and mental health support. This confirms the relevance of Stakeholder Theory (Freeman, as cited in Carroll, 2023) that asserts businesses must consider a wide array of stakeholder interests. But it also challenges companies that only gave lip service to stakeholder care before the pandemic. Griffin (2014) states that crises test reputation credibility; in the case of COVID-19, companies that addressed issues honestly with stakeholders kept trust, but others lost their reputations.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nThe pandemic then proved to be a litmus test for genuine CSR. A few organizations shifted gear to purpose-driven action, Unilever handed out complimentary hygiene items, while LVMH converted perfume factories into hand sanitizer production. Such action underlines Carroll's (2023) CSR Pyramid, demonstrating that companies are able to uphold ethical and philanthropic responsibilities even amidst crisis. Yet, other firms reduced CSR spending or applied CSR as publicity, validating Crane's (2016) fear that CSR is symbolic instead of strategic. COVID-19 thus both proved and experimented with theoretical foundations, depending on whether CSR was deeply ingrained or more performative.\nThird Sector\nThe third sector experienced both pressure and visibility. Charity and NGO demand, especially for vaccination outreach, mental health, and food banks, soared. However, funding decreased as governments and donors reallocated resources. This confirms Carroll's and Crane's contention that the third sector is a necessary partner in system-level crises. It also confirms Blowfield's contention that cross-sector working is the solution to sustainable change. However, the pandemic also revealed the weakness of those third-sector organizations that lacked any digital infrastructure or scalable support systems, highlighting a need for capacity-building.\nConclusion\nOverall, COVID-19 strengthened and challenged the strengths and vulnerabilities of current sustainability, CSR, and stakeholder theory. It strengthened such theories as frameworks that are based on ethical leadership, stakeholder interaction, and systemic resilience, but challenged models that were too globalized or superficial. Next-generation business models will be required to evolve accordingly, both theoretically and practically.\n \nSources\nBlowfield, M. (2013). Business and sustainability.

You can read more at:  Responsible Business in a post COVID-19 world | Deloitte SwitzerlandLinks to an external site.\nOne way to do this is through ethical supply chains such as ensuring eradication of child labour, ensuring safe and hygienic working conditions, ensuring employees are paid fairly for the hours worked, ensuring humane and non-discriminatory treatment, demonstrating environmental awareness and removing anti-bribery.\nTesco is an example of an organisation who use multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing.  For example they have an Action, Collaboration and Transformation group that ensures that those that make their garments achieve the living wage through collective bargaining and freedom of association.  They also engage with the Better Cotton Initiative which looks to improve cotton farming practices to bring economic, social and environmental benefits.  Tesco engage in over 30 different initiatives and you can read more about these here:  https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/documents/policies/tesco-and-multi-stakeholder-initiatives-for-responsible-sourcing/Links to an external site.\nConsidering these different factors, who is accountable for responsible business practices?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.2 Responsible Leadership\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.2 Responsible Leadership\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way organisations are lead and in 2020 business leaders had to respond to the crisis at pace with no previous experience to draw on.  They had to balance the safety of their front-line workers with need to enable staff to work from home.  Technology has enabled leaders to be more visible in organisations with some holding weekly company updates which would not have happened pre-COVID.  Also leaders are exposed to some of the social problems such as Black Lives Matter and have to consider how these impact their workforces.  Leaders have had to become more considerate to a wider range of stakeholder needs during the COVID years and have had to make value based and purpose drive decisions during this difficult time.  Leaders have had to create sustained social impact due to mental health and wellbeing responses to the pandemic with some employees refusing to attend the workplace.  They have had to demonstrate caring relationships with customers, employees, families and colleagues along with shareholders and front-line workers. \nAs outlined by CIPD in 2022, responsible leadership has three different levels which became apparent during the pandemic:\nIndividual: the personal integrity of leaders was a critical factor during COVID-19, with leaders under intense pressure. Many talked about needing to fall back onto their personal sense of right and wrong. They spoke of a new-found humility, born out of having to learn to listen to others. \nOrganisational: in terms of role-modelling a response, many felt liberated. People also spoke of ‘taking off their armour’, implying that pre-COVID-19, they were operating in an organisational system that stifled their personal sense of right and wrong. \nSocietal: leaders were heavily engaged with health services and government, trying to ascertain what their organisations could do to help society. Communicating far more with the outside world, albeit virtually, they were in the company of like-minded leaders, sharing a common purpose.  (CIPD, 2022)\nThe pandemic has changed the way we live and work and there is impatience about the pace of change particularly when change was very fast during the pandemic.  Society wants greater justice and fairness through pay rewards and we are seeing various organisations in 2022 starting to strike over pay and conditions.  Organisations are becoming flatter with empathy and accessibility to senior teams which was not seen pre-COVID.  Rana Foroohar reported that if the rich don’t give a bit more today, they may have to give a lot more tomorrow.’ (2022) Financial Times.\nWatch this YouTube video which redefines responsible leadership from Accenture World: 5 Elements of Responsible Leadership | AccentureLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about their comments in terms of responsible leadership?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.3 What now?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.3 What now?\n\nThroughout the lessons you have seen poor practices where COVID loans have been abused by fraudsters and how senior politicians helped their friends with business contacts.  Test and trace used huge amounts of money with the better off being able to avoid financial costs of self-isolation through being able to work at home.  Wage inequality is rising in the UK and fewer are working because of long-COVID and delays to NHS treatment. \nThe ex-conservative government have been accused of “partygate” through not following COVID-19 regulations against individuals who have faced severe suffering through eg loss of loved ones and not being able to attend funerals.  This has resulted in the UK population becoming disillusioned with government and the resignation of Boris Johnson.\nCOVID has changed our lives and people are eager to travel for leisure but hybrid working has had significant impact on public transport and the city economics as people are not travelling to work.   Even though employers are making staff attend the workplace, remote working is here to stay with 25% of all professional jobs in North America being removed by the end of 2022 and this is set to increase.  This home working environment provides many benefits in terms of physical and mental well-being and large companies such as Goldman Sachs have retreated and offering working from home policies.  However we are living through transformation with automation and AI which is changing the skills that organisations are looking for.\n\nDeliotte in their “Workforce of the Future 2030” report have suggested there will be four worlds of work:\nRed – incubator for innovation racing to give consumers what they want, using digital platforms to enable those with winning ideas to be successful, where ideas rule innovation and outpaces regulation with high risks\nBlue – the corporate is king where bigger is better and where organisation size and influence is the best way to protect their profit margins against intense competition and they grow at such a scale and exert influence to become more powerful and larger than national economies\nGreen – corporate social responsibility is business imperative and organisations are characterised by social conscience, sense of environmental responsibility and they focus on diversity, human rights and trust is the basic currency underpinning business and employment\nYellow – humans come first with social-first and community businesses finding the greatest success to prosper. Crowdfunded capital flows towards ethical and blameless brands where organisations have social heart and where humanness is highlight valued.\nWhy not read more from this report

transformation and defining their own ambition level for each of the action fields in their sustainability strategy.  They will need to consider whether they will focus on a certain area or wider range of sustainability measures to remain competitive.   Organisations that fail to make these changes and address sustainability are likely to pose risks to their own business in terms of reputational damage, environmental risks and supply chain risks.  Organisations must make sustainability their guiding principles to boost energy efficiency through increased levels of recycling or rethinking their business model to discover new market potential. \nThe UK government has a 25 year sustainability plan which mainly focuses on environmental effects such as lowering carbon footprint, minimising waste and enhancing biodiversity on their sites.  The government also aims to enhance local communities and business to better contribute to quality of life for future generations.   Some of the work is based in previous mining areas of the UK which have suffered significant disadvantage through the loss of mining as income but also damage to the environment in these areas.  \n (Sustainability plan - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)Links to an external site..\nThe UK government have set targets to ensure better jobs and earning potential across all supply chains, developing prosperous communities across the UK, using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently, minimising ecological damage, considering the impact of climate change and minimising waste.\nCarry

responsibility and changing world of work.  Due to COVID 19 the speed of change across the world has intensified and organisations need to consider and develop these practices to be really sustainable and responsible businesses of the future.  They also need to consider problems the world is facing in relation to climate change, poverty, rising cost of living related to energy costs, online GP appointments and hospital visits and self-driving cars.  Producing foods including meets which are less harmful to the environment will be a key challenge for agriculture and overall a key investment

of right and wrong and we will consider this firstly from a moral, rather than a business perspective.  Ethical theory underpins the study of business ethics, and it is important that you have a grasp of this as you work through this module as you will need to demonstrate your understanding throughout the assessment.   Therefore the theory of ethics attempts to provide a clear, unified account of our own ethical obligations.  There are three main theories of ethics which you will review during this week – utilitarian, deontological and virtue ethics. \nHowever there are also Normative ethical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong from a given situation (Crane and Matten, 2016).  We will look at these in the next section.  They are important to the ways that businesses make decisions that can be defended, justified and explained to relevant stakeholders.  These theories will differ in terms of how you determine the moral worth of an action, and we will explore this during this week.  So where do ethics and theory of ethics come from?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\nv2.2 Where has ethics come from?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.2 Where has ethics come from?\n\nEthics is underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics and we will review each of these in this section.  There is a long history of ethical theory and the decision of right and wrong has been of utmost importance since life began and, in some cases, it is a matter of life and death for people across the world.\n\nFigure 1:  Image showing ethics underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics\nOver time the arenas for these ethical discussions have developed into organised religion, schools of philosophy, and political movements and parties.  The ethical discussions we have today, including those in a business context are, therefore, shaped by our own historical, religious, and cultural backgrounds, which can of course be very different depending on where we’re from.  And these categories have always and still do overlap.\n\nReligion\nRules and principles of religion advise us that there should be no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct or intoxicants through the religious teachings.  Religion and faith are a set of rules of how to act ethically and spiritually and there are consequences for the actions in terms of salvation, enlightenment, reincarnation or damnation. \nTherefore religion teaches us to:\ndemonstrate honesty and fidelity to family and those we know\nbe non-violent, demonstrate self-restraint, non-stealing, purity, truth\nconsider how every breach of promise in commerce is a sin\nlove one’s enemies, turn the other cheek\nhow morality for you and for others, including business behaviour\nLet’s look at religion and the six here are divided into three from the far east and south asia, and three what are called Abrahamic religions.\nBuddhism is concerned with the good life as we live it\nConfucianism the duty is more about people we know closely, more than the general responsibility to all others\nHinduism tenets are more universal, we should be like this with everyone\nJudaism is specific about business – more on this than on food/kosher etc in the holy texts.\nChristianity similar to Judaism but also talks of 7 sins and 7 virtues\nIslam forbids the charging of interest\nInfluence of religion endures today, however there are differences between Catholic/Lutheran and Calvinist traditions in Europe and the USA and there are specific injunctions around abstaining from economic life (holy days) or the practice of charging interest.  Interfaith declaration (1994) set key principles of justice; mutual respect; stewardship; honesty and recently religious figures have been commenting on business practice, investing or divesting wealth in various industries.   An example of this is where the Church of England tried to rescue Wonga (the loans company) and convert it to a non-profit organisation. It was asked to stop investing in Amazon, but hasn’t, despite saying it was a bad company.  The Church of England is an investor not just a faith and they have an investment fund valued at £9.2 billion which has been criticised for where it invests this funding, and this fund has received a return of 8.5% per year.  It plans to divest from fossil fuel companies by 2033, although some leading figures in the Church of England and its investment board have a background in companies like BP and Esso and therefore whether this will happen or not is open to discussion.\nThinking about Christianity and Easter and Christmas and business closure at these times of the year.  How do organisations overcome the differences when some of the employees do not celebrate these events and therefore eg have to have different practices in place for other religions?\nIn the UK there are still examples of traditional Christian practices such as lack of Sunday opening across some businesses and being the day when families attended church. \nWhat other practices can you think of that have a religious focus?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\n\nEthical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong for any given situation, for example:\nNormative ethical theories are those that propose to prescribe the morally correct way of acting\nDescriptive ethical theories seek to describe how ethics decisions are actually made in business\nWhen it comes to the role of ethical theory, there are two extreme positions\nEthical absolutism asserts eternal, universally applicable moral principles:\nRight and wrong are objective qualities, can be rationally determined\nEthical relativism claims morality is context-dependent and subjective:\nNo universal rights & wrongs that can be rationally determined, all depends on person making the decision, culture in which they operate\nThe following image shows a typology of ethical theories and how they are divided into conduct and character and then the different theories such as egoism, utilitarianism, Kantianism, Aristotelianism.\nCan you think of an example of poor ethical conduct at work?\nCan you think of poor ethical characters at work? \n2.4 Unilitariansim\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.4 Unilitariansim\n\nAccording to utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it results in the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people affected by the action, and also names as the “greatest happiness principle” which is based on a similar approach to cost-benefit analysis.  Jeremy Bentham contributed to this theory, and he suggested that “humans are motivated by avoidance of pain and gain of pleasure” resulting in “consequentialist” theory of ethics.  “Consequentialism” means the moral quality of an action is determined by its consequences eg right or wrong will depend on the consequences of an act eg lying is wrong but if it saved it a life then it would be right (moral quality of the action). \n\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724-1804) derived ethics of duty and argued that morality and decisions about right and wrong are not dependent on situation or actions.   He suggested that morality was defined by a set of moral rules that humans should apply to all relevant ethical problems (Crane and Matten, 2016).   He suggested three principles that constitute a “test” of whether a particular action should be ethical.\nPrinciple 1: Consistency - Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\nPrinciple 2: Human Dignity - Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only.\nPrinciple 3: Universality - Act only so that actions are “universally lawgiving” i.e. that rules guiding our actions are acceptable to every rational human being, not because they have been told to accept them i.e. would others agree with you?\n \nConsider the following transplant dilemma:\nA brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveller, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine check-up. In the course of doing the check-up, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor.\nDo you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.6 Virtue Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.6 Virtue Ethics\n\nVirtue ethics uses character and integrity-based approaches to business ethics with the message “good actions come from good persons” (Crane and Matten, 2016).   These contend that morally correct actions are those undertaken by actors with virtuous characters. Therefore, the formation of a virtuous character is the first step towards morally correct behaviour and not just a one-off decision Some of the acquired traits are:\nIntellectual virtues – “wisdom”\nMoral virtues – “honesty”, “courage,” “friendship”, “mercy”, “loyalty”, “modesty”, “patience” etc.\nEthics of virtue are central to the notion of “good life” and Aristotle argued that when we do something we do it to gain an end and that the ultimate end of all ends was the chief good, the greatest good.  Aristotle suggested that the best businessman is the one who practices virtue, not the one who makes the most money and this is because s/he can be satisfied with that goodness.   Therefore, if it’s good for you it will be good for all and thinking it’s good for all will help you be good.\n\nTopic 2\n2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\n\nEthics can be defined by natural rights or alternative frameworks that focus on relationships such as eg feminist ethics.  Natural rights are based on basic, important, unalienable entitlements that should be respected and protected in every single action, such as:\nbased on consensus about nature of human dignity\nstrongly based in western view of morality\nWhereas justice is the simultaneously fair treatment of individuals in a given situation with the result that everybody gets what they deserve such as:\nFair procedures (procedural justice)\nFair outcomes (distributive justice)\nThere are strong in the western tradition and flows from politics.  However should we all receive equal benefit?  Or should we strive for equal access to opportunity?\nThere are some limits of traditional theories in that they are:\nToo abstract\nToo reductionist\nToo objective and elitist\nToo impersonal\nToo rational and codified\nToo imperialist\nDo you think we look to alternative approaches?\n\nPlease use the accordions to reveal more information\nFeminist ethics\nDiscourse ethics\n\n\n\nPluralist approach\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.8 Ethical Decision making\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.8 Ethical Decision making\n\nEthical decision making is the process you would follow to ensure that decisions are based on ethical values.  For example, thinking of COVID-19 and health care professionals, many ethical dilemmas were presented in terms of making life and death decisions whilst allocating scarce resources eg such as the ventilators.  Ethical decision-making focuses on clarifying thinking about the issues, assist in the analysis of the issues involved and providing a rational way to defend a particular course of action.    Decisions have to be made on the best available information and information and personal choices must be respected.  These are generally concerned with decision making and particularly in making models of how this occurs, and ethical theories, principles and values can help but won’t solve the dilemma on their own. \nSo what is an ethical decision?  It is one that:\nIs likely to have significant effects on others\nIs likely to present with a number of choices\nOne or more party perceives this as an ethical question – even if you do not! If you use someone’s Netflix login you probably don’t care. Do they?\nThe diagram below provides a framework for understanding ethical decision making:\nFramework for understanding ethical decision-making\n2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\n\nRights and duties are really important in the workplace and Crane and Matten (2019, pg. 292) have produced a list resulting in a code of contract for ethical employment and it covers some of the “grey areas” which are not always covered by employment laws and regulations.\n \nFigure 4L  Rights and duties of employees (Crane and Matten, 2019, p.292)\nThe rights and duties of employees sets out the relationship between them and it offers the employees benefits in exchange for performance and for adhering to the rules.    Organisations need to provide training and outline the values of business ethics to employees in order to improve ethical decision-making in the workplace.  Senior leaders need to be the role models and demonstrate ethical behaviours and they need to be accountable for ethical violations and ensure they keep their promises and commitments to the workplace.   However organisations need to be careful as ethical decisions could be influenced by reward eg doing the right thing is rewarded for example, financially by managers and these practices need to be embedded within the values and practices demonstrated across the organisation.   Therefore ethical behaviour should be rewarded, and unethical behaviour should be punished.  Stakeholders have power to influence leaders and they should ensure that pressure is placed on stakeholders to act both ethically and unethically.\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\n\nThere is no longer a “job for life” and employees will experience different jobs and even careers across their working lives.   Post-Fordism is the term that is used to demonstrate how industrial production has moved away from huge production factories, pioneered by Henry Ford towards now where we have very much a knowledge economy.  In the Fordist era there were strong trade union representation and employees were given annual rises related to productivity and industrial peace (no strikes).  However we now are facing the rise of the “precariat” worker who has little or no job security (eg Uber drivers), little or no savings and many are often migrants to the UK or from BAME backgrounds.  Jobs such as Uber driving offers some semi-regular pay from very low-skilled work.  Currently young people have massive university debt that they are struggling to repay and graduates with a degree but few employment prospects.  As Uber drivers are classed as “workers” rather than “employees” they were not entitled to some basic rights such as sick leave, holiday pay and the minimum wage, however following a legal battle in 2021, Uber has now agreed to pay these to their drivers.  These drivers are typically contracted under non-standard arrangements eg on zero-hour contracts or independent contracts or through an agency.  These contracts really help employers cut costs and say in business; however it is a huge exploitation of individual employment rights. \n\nSome Business Examples of ethical practices during the Pandemic\nDuring the pandemic Cineworld closed down and staff found out through twitter and news reports rather than directly from management within the organisation.\nSecondly, Boohoo were part of the Levitt enquiry which focussed on duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain.\nThe enquiry found:\nBoohoo’s extraordinary commercial growth has been so fast that its governance processes have failed to keep pace.\nIt has concentrated on revenue generation sometimes at the expense of the other, equally important, obligations which large corporate entities have.\nIt has not felt responsible for conditions in the Leicester factories on anything other than a superficial level; and\nOn occasions it has failed to appreciate that with the enormous advantages of being a publicly listed company come responsibilities, one of which is on all occasions to act in the best interests of all the shareholders\nA conclusion was reached that the true reason that Boohoo did not become more involved in monitoring conditions in Leicester was that it saw it as being a lower priority than matters which directly affected the company (such as commercial issues or their own employees). The Leicester workers were not employed by them and so they were not their responsibility in the way that their own workforce is. To some extent this is understandable, but can lead to serious issues of the kind which Boohoo is now facing\nSports Direct and Amazon are also facing similar criticisms and you should read the case studies about some of their poor practices in the workplace:\nAmazon - Amazon raises wages amid criticism - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nSports Direct - Sports Direct staff 'not treated as humans', says MPs' report - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about these organisations?  Would it entice you to go and work for them?\n\nDiversity and Inclusion at Work\nDiversity and inclusion have become important practices within the workplace and research suggests that a more diverse workforce is good for business such as that:\nIt can lead to more creative problem solving, innovation, and being more responsive to change.\nGives a better knowledge of diverse markets / clients.\nOrganisation has a wider talent pool to draw from.\nIt can be a PR boost from being seen to manage diversity well.\nIt can lead to higher profits -10% increase in women in organisation linked to 3% in increase in profits\nMany organisations still have a white male orientated senior leadership team in the UK and although things have been changing BAME and women are still underrepresented at senior levels in organisations.   Part of this is due to women still being classified as care workers and working part-time to be carers.   The UK introduced the gender pay gap so that organisations with over 250 employees have to publish the differences in averages between men and women, however in 2021 there was still gaps in the amount men and women were paid eg in education women were paid 26% less than men.  Gary Lineker working for the BBC was the second highest paid star at the corporation and paid more than women in similar roles.  Organisations have to address these challenges through fair procedures and although discrimination is wrong, poor practices in the workplace are still being evidenced.  This is an area for conflict as employees want to be paid the fairest and highest pay whilst employers want to pay the lowest to increase their profits and there has to be balance between high pay and high profits. \n \n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nIssues Involved\nRight to freedom from discrimination.\nEqual opportunities.\nAffirmative action.\nReverse discrimination.\nSexual and racial harassment.\nRight to privacy\nHealth and drug testing.\nWork-life balance.\nPresenteeism.\nElectronic privacy and data protection.\nRight to due process\nPromotion.\nFiring.\nDisciplinary proceedings.\nRight to participation and association.\nOrganization of workers in works councils and trade unions.\nParticipation in the company's decisions.\nRight to healthy and safe working conditions.\nWorking conditions.\nOccupational health and safety.\nRight to fair wages.\nPay.\nIndustrial action.\nNew forms of work.\nRight to freedom of conscience and speech.\nWhistleblowing.\nRight to work.\nFair treatment in the interview.\nNon-discriminatory rules for recruitment.\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nIssues Involved\nDuty to comply with labour contract\nAcceptable level of performance.\nWork quality.\nLoyalty to the firm.\nDuty to comply with the law.\nBribery\nDuty to respect the employer's property.\nWorking time.\nUnauthorized use of company resources for private purpose:\nFraud, theft, embezzlement.\n\nSUBSECTIONS TO COVER:\n\nPurpose:\n- Requirements: Critically explore issues and review literature on how ethical questions are manifested in the modern workplace.\n- Word Count: 700\n- Theories/Models: Carroll’s CSR Pyramid, Stakeholder Theory\n- Required Readings: Carroll (1991), Freeman (1984)\n\nENHANCED GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

Or should organisations who make the wealth and set the standards we work to and live by be the ones that dictate this fairness?\nThere are some obvious talking points here, not just in the UK but across the world as authoritarian leaders focus on national interests to change behaviours.  However culture also plays a part as it needs to consider the interactions between different groups across society.  The following examples discuss how culture impacts different groups in everyday existence.\n\nFor example, in 2019 Parkfield primary school, a largely Muslim school suspended lessons about LGBT rights and homophobia following protests from parents.  The lessons had been designed to help children accept differences in society and teach them about religion, gender identify, age and disabilities.  However following criticism from some of the schools’ Muslim parents relating to same sex-couples education in the lessons the school suspended these lessons.  Parents insisted that the classes were not appropriate for their children by keeping them at home from lessons on a Friday.  The school suspended the lessons and the children returned to school.\nA second example is where an older generation of feminists (represented by JK Rowling) were confronted by angry activists for not supporting trans rights.  Rowling took to Twitter following a tweet that read “people who menstruate” instead of what she should thought should be “women who menstruate” and then went to add “If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. . . . I do not believe it’s hateful to say so.” (NY Post, 2020).  This tweet resulted in thousands of replies declaring Rowling a transphobic, bigoted TERF (trans-exclusion radical feminist) and impact of globalisation and different cultures and their values.\nSome of the factors that contribute to these differences are identified through Demographic methods (DEMOG).  Recent political surveys have shown huge generational differences between how older and younger adults view issues from climate change, through to Brexit and immigration and up to how we should respond to the pandemic.  However gender differences are more nuanced such as where the majority of white women voted for Trump to be elected, compared with less among white men.\nEconomic factors can also influence perceptions and views across society.  For example, automation can cost jobs, or improve productivity.  Which way do you think it will go?  The world of work has been changing significantly over the last few years, but Covid has also speeded this up with more hybrid and home working.\nGlobalisation is another factor that has significantly impacted sustainability and responsible business practice as it focuses on the key context for business practice such as through imports, exports and business location.  Globalisation has seen businesses being able to buy, sell and produce goods across the world, sometimes buying materials at a lower cost or producing where labour is most experienced or even cheaper to help with their own bottom line.  Globalisation is a topic that we will review throughout this module and each of the weeks to come.\nThe image below shows the largest container ship, which represents an emblem of the steady growth in international trade since the mid-90s, when the Word Trade Organisation, the global body dealing with the rules of trade, was established.   Up to 2021 the value of global trade had reached a record level of $28.5 trillion which was an increase of 25% on 2020 and 13% higher than 2020 (Unctad, 2021). \n\nFig1:  World Trade Organisation (2020)\nEven more dramatically, since 1950 we have seen a total increase in trade volumes of 4220%.  So what does this mean for you, your organisation and sustainability and responsible business practice?\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment and is as important as making and growing the organisation.  Organisations need to be productive without negatively impacting people, the planet or the environment and one way they  can do this is through ethical behaviour.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\nv1.2 Ethics and the Law\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.2 Ethics and the Law\n\nBusiness ethics is the study of business situations, activities and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed such as through how different organisations treat their customers, their staff, the planet and even their suppliers (Crane and Matten, 2016).  They are interrelated terms that can exist separately although most ethical considerations and are usually legally enforceable.  They describe the ways business should behave. It provides the social, cultural, legal and economic limitations to protect the interests of various stakeholders.  It also emphasis moral and social values such as welfare, consumer protection and fair business practices.   For example, thinking about the introduction of the government policy relating to plastic shopping bags.  This policy was to emphasis sustainability and to protect resources for future generations as well as reducing the use of single-use carrier bags to encourage people to reuse bags.  The scheme has so far worked as there has been a reduction of supplied single-use carrier bags  by over 95% and the money raised has totalled nearly £180m for good causes.\nBusiness needs to operate ethically to be successful and they need to create their own ethical business practices (EBP) which includes a culture where individuals in the business make decisions and act in ways that build sustainable business.  They also need to show a care for all the needs of the stakeholders working within these ethical and legal guidelines. Organisations that demonstrate unethical behaviours are usually named and shamed on social media sites and research has shown that up to 50% of customers are concerned with unethical businesses practices and are therefore prepared to move their business to more ethically proven business.  \n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.3 Globalisation\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.3 Globalisation\n\nAccording to Scholte (2005) globalization is not:\n‘internationalization’\n‘liberalization’\n‘universalization’\n‘westernization’\nGlobalization is a process which diminishes the necessity of a common and shared territorial basis for social, economic, and political activities, processes, and relations  and can result in deterritorialization (where a territory has its organisation destroyed through growth of cultural flows).   As we have seen earlier, globalisation has intensified since 1989 and this has  been caused by the collapse of the Eastern Block (former communist states in East and Central Europe eg Soviet Union, Albania, Yugoslavia for example) in 1989 when the cold war came to an end and the Berlin Wall came down.  This resulted in wider range of countries opening their borders and allowing people to escape to the West.   China has also contributed to global wealth during this time through foreign investment resulting in it boosting its exports of technology and capital which has allowed it to grow to be the second largest economy after the US. \nThere are many organisations that have benefitted from globalisation, and I imagine you can name a few.  However, one of the organisations that has benefitted from this is Nike who has manufacturing plants in almost every country of the world except Russia, most of African and some of the Middle East.  Nike’s set up factories across the world and now employ over 1.02 million workers in 42 countries to produce all its products.  29% of its products are made in China and 44% in Vietnam.  Only 76,000 of employees are actually employed by Nike.  However through globalisation Nike has been able to extend is sale of products and services from US to all over the world developing its brand and economic success. \n\n\nEconomically, there are gains, but how are these gains distributed across the different countries of the world?\nInterestingly, Switzerland, Ireland and Holland are in the top 3 countries across the world that have benefitted in terms of growth of income with Ireland being one of the most globalised economies.  The globalisation index by the Bertelsmann Foundation measures economic, political and social aspects of worldwide network economies and ranks countries overall.  Ireland has increased its globalisation rating due to its favourable climate, its central location between North America and Asia and its tourism appeal.  Ireland has also attracted foreign investment through these positive characteristics but also through having the population who are fluent in English.  The republic of Ireland has been a full member of the EEU and therefore been able to position itself well, particularly in relation to Brexit.  It also has low population density which means that there is room for growth.\nGlobalisation has allowed for free trade; it has lowered or abolished tariffs which has  increased the movement of labour and goods across several countries.  This has allowed organisations to focus on an area in which it represents competitive advantage such as through lack of regulation of global financial or cheaper labour.  Shareholders have sometimes looked at profit over ethical working practices, and example of this is Primark. In 2009, Primark were found to be employing illegal workers and paying their staff less than the minimum wage by using child labourers to produce their garments in refugee camps in Southern India.  The working conditions were very poor, but this child labour enabled Primark to grow through cheap production costs in a country outside of the UK.  This negatively impacted their brand and Primark has worked hard to rectify these poor practices over the last few years by signing up to an Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI’s) base code of labour practices based aligned to the International Labour Organisation standards.  This is an example of where Primark was able to outsource production to developing countries in order to reduce their costs in the global marketplace.  This has been positive as it provides jobs in these developing countries, but it also raises the potential for exploitation of employees through poor working conditions.  More than this, jobs in industrialized regions of developed countries have been put at risk, something which Donald Trump talked about very effectively in the 2016 US election. \nGlobalization can bring cheaper prices to consumers, but vulnerable consumers in developing countries may also face the possibility of exploitation by Multinational Corporations (MNCs).  These products can provide social benefits to consumers; however this can also be met with protests about cultural imperialism and westernization in less wealthy countries.   Global business activity brings the company in direct interaction with local communities and has the possibility of raising the erosion of traditional community life.\n\nGlobally active pressure groups emerge with aim to “police” corporations in counties where governments are weak and corrupt.  One example of global pressure groups is Greenpeace.  It was formed in 1971 to protect natural resources.  They are currently working with others to protect our natural world due to rising sea levels, extreme weather as the climate breaks down through destructive industries which pollutes forests, oceans and the air.  In 2020, they protested against Shall Oil and their plan to pollute the North Sea by abandoning an estimated 11,000 tonnes of oil on the sea.  The protestors on the Greenpeace Ship, Esperanza approached a 500m exclusion zone of Shell’s platform waving banners and calling on Shell to clean up its mess. \n\nFigure 2:  Greenpeace at Brent Oil Rigs (The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site.)\nShell wanted to dismantle these platforms in the sea as cheaply as possible, putting profit before people, however Greenpeace insisted that these platforms must be removed in an environmentally friendly manner.   You can read more about the Brent Story and Shell’s sustainability here - The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site..  As at March 2022 a decision is on the way but as, yet this has not been published.\nGlobalization weakens governments and increases corporate responsibility, for example, jobs, welfare, maintenance of ethical standards through increased budgetary pressures. Globalization confronts governments with corporations from regions with different cultural expectations about issues such as bribery, corruption, taxation, and philanthropy and decisions have to be made how to co-operate in an ethical and legal way, for example when organisations try to bribe the local government officials to accept their plan for redevelopment of premises, for example which is not in the best interests of the local community.\n\nHowever, globalization is good for all of us as it provides us with a much wider range of products and services and access to experiences we would not have in our own country.  However, turning our backs on globalization would take us down the wrong path.   It is the emerging and developing countries which have achieved only below average levels in the globalization index thus far and therefore still have great potential to globalize. By doing so, they could generate correspondingly high globalization-induced growth effects. This is why it is essential that emerging countries become better integrated into the global economy. In industrialized countries, it is necessary to spread the benefits of globalization more widely so that social acceptance of an open society is not lost.” Overall, if globalization (measured by various indicators) increases by 1%, there is a .33% increase in GDP.    You can read more about the global index here:  https://kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2021/12/kof-globalisation-index-2021.html#:~:text=The%20KOF%20Globalisation%20Index%20measures,the%20period%201970%20to%202019Links to an external site..\nThere is, however, considerable variation in impact on inequality in the developed world.  Broadly, in the US and UK, inequality has risen with globalization. In continental Europe and Japan, it hasn’t.  For example,  Equal Opportunities legislation has tried to target and ensure procedural justice is promoted through best practices and prosecuting those that do not comply.  In addition, pressure groups have grown in recent years attempting to address the social imbalances such as the Black Lives Matter movement who were founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer.  Their mission has been to eradicate white supremacy and build local power or to intervene in violence which is inflicted on Black communities.  This group has gained momentum through the murder of George Floyd and the group is being supported by celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton.   This is an example of a group that tries to advance the rights of under-represented individuals. However, there are many more.\nOrganisations have to comply with equal opportunities legislation such as the Equality Act 2010 in the UK and ensure for example during the recruitment practices, policies are fair and do not discriminate applications based on eg sex, race, age, religion etc.  Job descriptions need to be produced which provide fair criteria which applicants can be assessed against and use wording that does not discriminate applications, for example “only white males need to apply”.\nOnce individuals have been employed in an organisation then training programmes need to be open and fair to all of them, for example running programmes at a time of day that part-time staff can attend.  Organisations must ensure that they do not prioritise certain staff over others in terms of promotion to senior positions, particularly those from discriminated groups. \nOrganisations have moved to more diversity workforces and organisations like M&S and Metropolitan police have used targeted campaigns in London to try and address racial inequality through promoting equal opportunity for all, although they have had to be careful to ensure recruitment is still fair to all.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\n\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment, and it seeks to promote best practices to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources when developing products and services.   In 2022 we have seen souring temperatures across the UK and wildfires caused through climate change.  Organisations need to develop products and services without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs such as eg combating the o-zone layer (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)\nSustainability refers to the long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic and social considerations. \nOne of the ways to do this is through the triple bottom line:\n\nFigure 3:  Triple Bottom Line\nThe Triple bottom line model discussed by John Elkington in 1984 moved away from businesses focussing solely on financial performance but looked at people, planet and profitability which provided organisations with insight into the connections between environmental health, social wellbeing and the organisations financial success.\nThe traditional bottom line – profit – is supplemented by novel ways of accounting for an organisation's performance with respect to:\nPeople. How does the organisation stand in its treatment of employees, customers and the wider community? Is it doing all it can to maximise its performance in these areas?\nPlanet. How well is the organisation doing in its treatment of the natural environment? Is it using more resources than it needs to? Is it damaging the environment, through pollution or through making products, with poor environmental performance?\nAs we might expect from a model based on accounting, the triple bottom line model is particularly useful in providing checklists of areas of sustainability performance which an organisation should examine carefully.\nThe triple bottom line model can usefully be applied to all profit-making organisations and can also prove useful for non-profit organisations as well. For example, the diagram above has a close fit, in many areas, to the activities of an organisation like Anglia Ruskin University, since we have to pay attention to nearly all of the items listed in the diagram above – apart from total shareholder return.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.5 Covid-19\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.5 Covid-19\n\nSo what about the pandemic? What implications are there for business ethics?  Through the government measures to stem the spread of coronavirus some companies have positively put their employees before their profits ensuring both staff and customer safety as an overwhelming priority.  They have also cut executive pay rather than avoiding rising costs to customers. \nHowever, the government has bailed out companies on the brink of bankruptcy and has propped up wages of workers through furlough scheme which impacts organisations and society and does bring a question in terms of the balance of fairness. Organisations such as Netflix stated they would stop charging inactive customers and Unilever pledged to stop targeting children with adverts. Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on jobs, profits, trade and movement and even 4 years later travel is still a long way from where it used to be, however it has brought some positives in terms of hybrid working for employees, but this has also been at a cost to the high street.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 –Introduction to Sustainability & Responsible Business > 1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\n\nHere are 8 reasons why business ethics is a vital subject.  \nThese are:\nIt has power and influence of business in society\nPotential to provide major contribution to society\nPotential to inflict harm\nIncreasing demands from stakeholders\nLack of business ethics education or training\nContinued occurrence of ethical infractions\nEvaluating different ways of managing business ethics\nInteresting and rewarding\nCan you add any others?\nTherefore, throughout this first study week you have been introduced to some of the key concepts of sustainability and responsible business and the importance of ethical business practices.\n\nTopic 1\n\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nSocial\nPolitical\nCultural\nDemographic\nEconomic\nEquality\nDivisions\nPrejudice\nGenerational\nInequality\nFairness\nInstitutions\nXenophobia\nGender\nCSR\nMobility\nDemocracy\nRacism\nMigration\nBad practice\nVulnerability\nAccountability\nReligion\nWar\nTechnology\n \nTrade\nTraditions\nFamine\nGrowth\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761a8e-20564-Topic_3.docx ---\n3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Crisis > 3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\n\nThe United Nations was founded in 1945 with 51 original Member States and this international organisation is comprised of 193 Member States today.  The UN defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations.  The UN set up a commission to review the problems of economic development where global resources are limited.  Economists argued that economies could not grow as natural resources were finite and were becoming more difficult to obtain.  Therefore, if economic activity was to be 'sustainable' into the far future, more attention would have to be paid to rate at which resources were consumed.

The 8 goals were realistic and easy to communicate, with a clear measurement and monitoring mechanism.   However, in 2012 UN developed a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)s to fit the global development framework beyond 2015.  This created a new people-centred, development agenda and engaged citizens, scientists, academics and private sector in the process and created 17 new goals:\n\nFigure 2:  UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2015)\n\n3.4 Climate Change\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals & the Climate Crisis > 3.4 Climate Change\n\nClimate change is already impacting public health, food and water security, migration, peace and security. Climate change, left unchecked, will roll back the development gains we have made over the last decades and will make further gains impossible.  The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) outlined some agreements in terms of the global agenda on climate change for the next decade and the\nCountries agreed to:\nmeet further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide to try to keep temperate rises within 1.5oC\nreduce the use of coal\nincrease money to poor countries to help with effects of climate change\nphase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or natural gas\nUS and China to cooperate and switch to clean energy\nstop deforestation by 2030\nClimate change impacts our food in terms of weather conditions such as increase in temperatures and rain fall which impact the quality of our foods, such as flooding the fields and destroying the crops.  Mortality rates can increase due to impact of food availability and can limit worker productivity.  Flooding can spread disease and damage the ecosystem and therefore, lowering emissions is believed to be one of the biggest impacts on lessening harmful impacts to health. \nIn 2021, the UN reported that more than 59 million people were displaced within their homelands through weather related events such as floods, storms and cyclones. \n\nFigure 4:  Unocha:  A displaced persons camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nOrganisations that revisit production practices and work on reducing emissions through good practices will help overcome some of the challenges with climate change.  Governments can help address social problems such as through global financial markets, climate and the internet and therefore there are many areas of business that are not explicitly regulated.  There is expectation that businesses will address these volatile financial markets, consider climate change during their production processes and consider issues such as internet privacy. \nRead the case study on page 133 of the core text “the politics of the oil sands” and the different stances of both the US and Canadian governments and the impact this is having on climate change.\n\nTopic 3\nPrevious\nNext\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nGoal 1\nEradicate extreme poverty and hunger\nGoal 2\nAchieve universal primary education\nGoal 3\nPromote gender equality and empower women\nGoal 4\nReduce child mortality\nGoal 5\nImprove maternal health\nGoal 6\nCombating HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other diseases\nGoal 7\nEnsure environmental sustainability\nGoal 8\nDevelop a global partnership for development\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nGoal 1Links to an external site.\nEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere\nGoal 2Links to an external site.\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture\nGoal 3Links to an external site.\nEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\nGoal 4Links to an external site.\nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all\nGoal 5Links to an external site.\nAchieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\nGoal 6Links to an external site.\nEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\nGoal 7Links to an external site.\nEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all\nGoal 8Links to an external site.\nPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all\nGoal 9Links to an external site.\nBuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation\nGoal 10Links to an external site.\nReduce inequality within and among countries\nGoal 11Links to an external site.\nMake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\nGoal 12Links to an external site.\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns\nGoal 13Links to an external site.\nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\nGoal 14Links to an external site.\nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development\nGoal 15Links to an external site.\nProtect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss\nGoal 16Links to an external site.\nPromote peaceful and inclus\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761c02-20564-Topic_4.docx ---\n4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\n\nThe actions that consumers take have an impact other people and those impacts can be positive or negative.  This is an example of a tweet that appeared discussing some of the problems with Amazon’s same delivery service and the impacts this has on the workers to search for, find and deliver products and services the same day. There are also the environmental impacts such as additional pollution in the environment.  Read the tweet below and then consider the questions below:\n\nWhen you order something for same day delivery do you consider the impact this has on workers or the environment and if so, would it persuade you to consider not same day deliver?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\nv4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\n\nOne of the key ethical tensions is between consumer rights versus the consequences of these activities.  The Declaration of Independence gave three examples of inalienable rights which were, to “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness”.  Sometimes these are known as natural rights.  Therefore, it is important to consider the following questions:\ndo consumers have a right to a product if the consequences of this are bad for society and/or the environment?\ndo consumers have a right to a product at a fair price?\ndo consumers have a duty to favour ethical companies in their purchasing decisions?\nObviously, the answer to some of these questions such as fair price is yes, however the consequences of this needs to be considered, e.g., is the fair price due to unfair labour practices such as child workers or paying below the minimum requirements then is it fair?\nConsumers have inalienable entitlements to fair treatment when entering into exchanges with sellers and there is a belief that consumer dignity should be respected.  Sellers have a duty to treat consumers as ends in themselves and not only as means to the end of the seller.  This should prevent misleading or deceptive practices and should aggregate social, cultural and environmental good practices.  These should therefore reduce inequality, exploitation, physical, emotional, mental and socio-cultural harm. \n\nThinking of tourism as an industry which includes human behaviour, the use of resources, communication with people, economies, the environment and the physical movement of the tourists to location impacts a number of different communities in both positive and negative ways. \nPositively tourism brings money into the community, can help with job creation, brings investment and triggers economic growth. \nNegatively it impacts the environment in terms of pollution, the ecosystem in terms of use of water taken e.g., for swimming pools from other needed community sources or through the clearing of vegetation for hotels and resorts to build these near beaches or in core areas of the forest.  Walking can trample and destroy coastlines leading to a loss of species and destruction of habitats.   Cultural diversity can also be reduced, and this is known as cultural homogenisation which refers to the reduction in cultural diversity through popularisation and diffusion of cultural symbols or customs, ideas and values which become absorbed by the dominant outside culture.\n An example of this is McDonalidization where fast food restaurants are dominating around the world meaning that the same health standards are being adopted across the world and therefore this can have a negative impact on health and are changing the food choices of the country before McDonalidization.\nCrane et al., 2019, identified a number of ethical issues for consumers within key industries as shown below:\n\nFigure 1:  Ethical issues for consumer within key industries.\nCan you think of any others? \nOrganisations need to deal with consumers ethical such as ensuring product safety and fitness for purpose or making sure during marketing activities there are no misleading claims or price fixing for example. \n\nOne of the issues that consumers criticise companies of is pricing.  Consumers want to purchase these as at the lowest cost, but companies want to sell these for the maximum amount to increase their revenue.  In most countries, regulatory agencies police price fixing – however the main issues that are arise are:\nExcessive pricing – price gouging – that the fair prices for goods and services has been exceeded.  This may be based on market conditions.\nPrice fixing – collusion between competing firms to fix prices above the market rate – this is illegal in Europe and US but other countries of the word it can go unnoticed.\nPredatory pricing – anticompetitive practice when firm sets the price significantly lower than market rate to force out the competition.\nDeceptive pricing – true cost is deliberately obscured and sometimes the airline industry has been found to advertise prices which are only available on a few flights with substantial booking restrictions and no information about the additional taxes or charges.\nHave you experienced any of these practices?  What do you think?  How ethical are these companies?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\n\nTwo theories can be applied to consumers and the consequences of actions.  The first is deontological ethics which applies to consumer rights as it provides an underlying principle of an action that is good or right?  It assumes that good decisions are made by adhering to ‘good’ principles and doing the right thing because it is the right thing to do.  If you follow rules and fulfil duties. \nDeontological ethics relies on the normative theory that morality of action is based on whether the action is right or wrong rather than based on the consequences of the action, for example do not kill, do not steal, follow religious beliefs and keep promises made. \nHowever, in contrast,  teleological ethics consider the consequences of actions and if they are morally the best (or consequentialist ethics).  For example, killing for promotion is wrong but killing in self-defence could be deemed as moral and the right decision made on the best consequences.  It therefore considers the outcome of the action good being good and whether the goal of the action or decision leads to good outcomes.  Overall, the better outcomes an action produces, the better it is.\nThis image shows the differences between the two:\n\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\n\nAs you have already started to see, consumers have various rights when purchasing goods and services and in the UK they are protected by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  This act gives the consumer a legal right to a refund for goods or services that are unsatisfactory or unfit for use or to get it repaired in certain circumstances.\nIn 2009, Tata Motors introduced a new model, The Tata Nano and described it as ‘The People’s Car’  with a price of around £1,075 at launch, with the price dropping by 30% within a year.  It was stated to be safer than alternative models of transport such as motorbikes, scooters, motor-rickshaws, and it was a lot cheaper.  It therefore potentially satisfied millions of lower-income people dream of owning a car. \nHowever, on the other hand, it was potentially ‘socially and environmentally disastrous’ as it was bringing countries to gridlock through increased traffic, pollution was impacted through the use of motor vehicles, damaging the environment.  In addition, the land for Nano factories had  been acquired controversially as some of the land had previously been the ‘most fertile’ farmland in locality.\nHowever, in 2010 reports emerged of fires in a handful of Nanos, amid wider concerns that cost-cutting made the car unreliable and safe, and it was discontinued in 2020 due to safety concerns. \nConsider the following question:\nDo people in developing countries have the right to products available to developed countries if these will have net negative consequences for society / the environment?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\n\nThis was one of the questions highlighted earlier – do you think consumers do have the right to a fair price?\nConsumers do have the right to a fair price and as we have seen in earlier topics, employers and employees can conflict during the production process as employers want to minimise costs and maximise revenue through reduced costs such as lower wages resulting in tensions between consumers and producers to maximise this cost revenue.   An example of this is that in 2015, Martin Shkreli was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a 60-year-old life-saving drug by over 5000% overnight taking the costs from $13.50 to $750 in the USA and by comparison it costs $0.66 in the UK.  His company had a monopoly on the drug, and this was not the first-time aggressive pricing has been brought in.  However even 2.5 years later the price hadn’t changed but the company was trying to make it less expensive to hospitals.   He was solely motivated by profits and was successful as there was no alternative to the drug for low-income patients.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.6 Ethical Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.6 Ethical Consumption\n\nProfessor Craig Smith, in 1995 and 1996 published research relating to ethical consumption and how consumers were boycotting unethical companies showing how customers do take ethical considerations into purchasing decisions.    Thinking  back to the child workers and poor labour practices in the production of Primark’s clothing, customers could have boycotted Primark until they resolved these unethical practices.\nHowever, boycotting unethical companies was found not to be consistent, and companies could justify unethical consumption.  Think about chocolate production and how Fairtrade was introduced.  Fairtrade is about better prices, safe working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers.  Fairtrade ensures that workers are paid fairly and providing better terms of the farmers.  Would you boycott a company that was producing chocolate unethically?  Would the companies survive?\nIn perfect competition (where  in a market buyers and sellers are so numerous and well informed that all elements of monopoly are absent and the market price of a commodity is beyond the control of individual buyers and sellers), customer demand drives market. \nThis means that the customer is King, and the customers will move to a different seller if they are not satisfied.  Therefore, is consumer sovereignty the ‘Key’ to truly ethical consumption? \nA consumer sovereignty test can measure:\nconsumer capability to make free decisions without vulnerability or coercion.\nhow readily available, good quality information is relating to products.\nchoice between similar products with affordable switching costs.\nHaving the capability to choose between similar products, with good information about companies’ ethical stances enables consumers to make choices such as where there has been any animal testing, or the products have been produced in a sweatshop or used child labour.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\n\nDisaster capitalism refers to the development of profits based on some type of disaster.   For example, Donald Trump proposed a $700 billion dollar stimulus plan to eliminate payroll taxes which would lead to a reduction in social security funding.  Some other governors said that they wanted nothing to do with this plan as it was too expensive and how it would impact state and local funding as it was to divert the funds.  Sometimes, unethical conduct can pay more than ethical conduct, however in this case the plan was not implemented. \nAnother example is from Nathan Rothschild (c.1815), who said, “The best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.”  He made his fortune buying in the panic following the Battle of Waterloo as the better the opportunities, the better the profit. \nHowever, Warren Buffet warned that you can pay a high price in the stock market, particularly if everyone agrees with your investment decision.   Therefore, where there is social and economic turmoil this results in an opportunity and can lead to prospective business deals.  Consumers and citizens maybe too tired or distracted of what is happening to resist the changes.  This leads to the debate about ethical and unethical behavior.\nDo you think it is ethical to profit from the pandemic? \nNews stories relating to the amount of government spending and the unethical contracts awarded by ministers has led to discussions relating to unethical behavior.  However, organisations such as Netflix and Amazon have clearly profited from the pandemic due to increased home shopping and people staying at home.   Billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic, with top executives from technology and industry earning the most. \nThe world's richest saw their wealth climb 27.5% to $10.2trn (£7.9trn) from April to July this year, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS.  That was up from the previous peak of $8.9trn at the end of 2017 and largely due to rising global share prices.  UBS said billionaires had done \"extremely well\" in the Covid crisis and it also said the number of billionaires had hit a new high of 2,189, up from 2,158 in 2017.  However, it is expected that 150 million people, have been predicted to fall into extreme poverty next year, due to climate change, war, and now the pandemic, which is a new record.\nDo you think that companies should be rewarded for doing the right thing?  Should we not punish them for doing the wrong thing?  Are they doing the wrong thing?\nThinking about fast fashion, which is a business model that relies on cheap and speedy production of low-quality clothing which is rapidly produced and cycled in and out of the market quickly to meet new trends.  \nFashion brand Zara, coined the phrase stating it took them only 15 days to design, produce and sell garments in their stores.  This allowed them to develop more styles and to differentiate their fashion garments at a lower price through cheap and rapid production which is an example of encouraging excessive consumption. \nTheir business model encourages consumers to purchase cheap clothing and discard them quickly creating environmental problems through accumulating mountains of textiles and clothing every day, which are not biodegradable.\n After the deaths of 1,134 people during the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh Aleya Akter, a local union leader, expressed concerns that raising working standards in the country would cause businesses to pull out from the country.  He suggested that, as much as workers blame the brands for letting things get so bad in the first place, the last thing they want is for the industry to disappear”. \nThere are about 4 million garment workers and it’s impossible for them to get work anywhere else, because this is what they’re skilled to do. Not only are we asking for compensation for the brands, but we are also asking them: Do not walk away from us. Do not walk away from Bangladesh.\"\nCan consumers claim that their demand for fast fashion is ethical because it leads to jobs and investment in the developing world? \n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\n\nStudy Activity\nIn the 1970s South Africa and Apartheid was a system where legislation upheld segregation policies against non-white citizens.  Government policies were developed that discriminated socially, economically and politically against black majority.  However, these unethical practices called for international economic sanctions against South Africa, though these were not fully enforced.  This resulted in ‘Ethical’ companies which ceased business and some less ethical businesses continued.  Apartheid ended in the 1990s when FW de Klerk (South African president), repealed most of the social legislation, however racial segregation remained due to deeply entrenched in society.  Nelson Mandela was a key antiapartheid activist and the countries first black president. \nCoca Cola.docx\nActions\n \n\nRead through Coke and Pepsi’s response to apartheid.

The Ethical Consumer article focuses on Amazon's negative impact, especially its unethical practices like poor treatment of workers, environmental damage, tax avoidance, and data misuse. It takes a critical ethical stance, encouraging people to think beyond cheap prices and question the company’s actions. This reflects the moral absolutist or deontological stance mentioned in the lecture, where actions are judged as right or wrong regardless of the results.\nOn the other hand, the MoneySavingExpert article is more focused on deals and savings. It doesn’t talk about ethics—it simply helps people get the best prices on Amazon. This matches the consequentialist stance, where the outcome (saving money) is more important than how the company behaves.\nMy View on Amazon and Ethical Shopping:\nPersonally, I use Amazon sometimes, but I do feel uncomfortable about many of its practices, like worker mistreatment and avoiding taxes. I believe in ethical shopping, but I also know it’s not always easy or affordable. I try to buy from better companies when I can, especially for clothes, food, and home items.\nYes, I think some things are serious enough to boycott a company, like:\nModern slavery\nAnimal cruelty\nEnvironmental harm\nMistreating workers on purpose\nIf I know a company does these things and doesn’t try to improve, I would stop supporting them. I believe companies should care about people, animals, and the planet—not just profit.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1

a stakeholder in business\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, the government acts as the representative of citizens, and is expected to define the conditions which business must meet in order to operate, for example:\nWhat environmental laws to follow\nThe level of corporate taxation that organisations need to pay and.\nWhether one large company can merge with another\nThe aim of the government is to be re-elected, not just to serve its citizens and therefore is made up be elected individuals and these individuals have noble aims as they want to be re-elected in the future.  Their interests usually align with business to make business strong which should result in a booming economy, happy people with jobs and them having an income to spend across the community.  However they are also able to influence by competition in terms of education, health and entertainment such as through local authority owned theatres vs commercially owned or charitable theatres. \nThis image gives an outline as the government as a stakeholder of business:\n\n \nFigure 1:  Government as a stakeholder of business (Crane, et al., 2019, p482)\nOn the left-hand side of the image you will see that the government in principle represents an entire community since it is elected by the citizens of a certain town, region, country or even continent.  In this role as the elected representative of citizens’ interests.  This means that they define the conditions for the licence to operate of business as well as restricting and enabling business.  There is some debate about the degree of governmental responsibility for a functioning economy for example such as through laissez-faire vs. forceful role in industrial policy. \nOn the right hand of the image, the government have a self-interest to be re-elected and therefore they are very dependent on business and also compete with business.  In March 2022, the UK government has published significant reform proposals to drive change in competition and consumer law policy with the aim of boosting trade following Brexit.\nIt could be argued that the government has a conflict of interest between creating jobs and regulating business interests.  This image from Crane and Matten (2019) shows some of these relations and conflicts of interest as well as identifying some of the main sources of ethical problems which stem from fiduciary relation to society in general. \nThis shows Society on the right and the Government in the middle who are setting the standards and regulations in the UK to provide a stable environment for businesses to operate within. On the Right and in this stable environment business provides the taxes eg corporation, VAT etc to the government through providing employment and good work leading to growth in the economy.  Through business activities the government reviews how they can protect citizens in society such as through environmental regulations, paternity leave, minimum wage and other employment regulation and interventions.  These are signals from the government that they are looking after citizens and ensuring business protect Society.  However, the government are caught in the middle of conflicting demands in a bipolar situation.\n\nFigure 2:  Government between business and society interests (Crane et al, 2019, p.486)\nTherefore here we can see that business can have significant impact and influence on the implementation of government policies and business influence legitimacy and accountability are questioned.  Business can expect stable legal and economic frameworks, however if these demands interfere too much with their activities and leads to irresponsible lobbying and scrutiny in terms of accountability. \n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.3 Government choice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.3 Government choice\n\nStudy Activity\nSo governments have a choice in where they position themselves.   \nDo you think that the government is:\nPro business?\nFairness to workers?\nFairness to consumers?\nHow to balance these aspects?\nInterventionist or laissez faire?\nCan you think of any examples of each of these different choices that the government has to make?  Make a list of examples.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\n\nThe main ethical consideration arising from this situation is twofold as identified above:\nlegitimacy of business influence;\naccountability (Crane et al.,, 2019)\nBusinesses look to influence to government or public policy through legitimacy of business influences through corporate political activity and they do this through activities such as lobbying, political advertising, financial contributions, legal action and political campaigning.  \nYou will hear in the news how business have paid for government campaigns or have funded political parties in ways to lobby the government. \nFor example one of top Tory Party Donors in the UK in 2022 is JCB who donated over £2.5 million whilst Boris Johnson has been in power.  JCB Chairman has access to Boris Johnson’s top team as part of an elite “advisory board” who lobbied for early relaxation of lockdown measures inn 2020 and tax benefits for high net-worth individuals.  Others have been given public appointments or honours through giving donations.  Therefore business can have a significant influence on the implementation and direction of governmental policies. It is therefore no surprise that the issue of ‘public sector ethics has gained enormous momentum (Dobel 2007).\nIn terms of accountability to the public, one may contend that since the government acts as a representative of society’s interests, the public has a right to be informed about governmental decisions with other constituencies (such as business) and be able to determine whether it is acting in its interests or not.  Both parties are able to influence each other, the main concerns for business ethics are where business has influence on government.  There are numerous ways that business can influence government and Oberman (cited in Getz 1997, p59) distinguishes among different ways, using following criteria as to whether it is:\nThis gives different approaches to influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in 2008-9 as it had so many officials that had worked there from government posts.\nJapan has a tradition known as ‘Amakudari’, which means that Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high profile positions going into private and public sectors.  It means “descent from heaven”.  This example proved that in Japan, many contracts went to 70% of firms with links (no contest) to previous government bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you place these countries in (least corrupt first)?\nUSA\nRwanda\nDenmark\nSomalia\nColombia\nItaly\nUK\nClick here to reveal the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.6 Contemporary issues\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.6 Contemporary issues\n\nDuring the 1980s, the government in UK and USA started to privatise public industries such as telecommunication, rail and utilities for example.   In addition in the 1990s following the end of the USSR and the development of post-soviet transition from communism to capitalism there was massive scale investment in these countries which you have seen is where the growth of globalisation has come from.\nIn 2013, the Post Office in the UK was floated on the stock exchange through selling shares to private investors.  Representations from the firm, Lazard, were paid £1.5m by the government for flotation advice relating to the Post Office.  They followed their own recommendations and bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p to reap a profit of £8.4m.  Is this ethical?    One could argue no and their profit was based on insider information.\nDuring the pandemic we have seen that normal procurement rules were suspended and therefore this was open to cronyism. \nA report by the BMJ in 2021, identified that 1/5th of all UK government contracts contained a “red flag” which were indicators of possible corruption.   These contracts were worth £3.7 bn and it was identified that companies bidding for contracts were channeled through “VIP” or “high priority” channels because of their political connection and 30 contracts were awarded to companies with connections to the Conversative Party.  Is this ethical?\nGlobalization has made companies arguably more powerful than many governments.   Thinking about Amazon which is at no.55 if it was a country – ahead of oil rich Qatar and Walmart is bigger than Belgium.   Globalisation has enabled organisations to develop into poorer countries for example increasing their footprint in many countries, resulting in improving democracy to corrupting failed states to all in between.\nWhat moral duty do they have? \nFor example, Amazon and other organisation are able to avoid one tax regime in favour of another and the issue of trade and tariffs become paramount. \nIncreasingly, action on the environment is global and there is less room to hide.  You have to ask, what is the point of profiting in the next 10 years? \nBusinesses complained for centuries about red tape, and they are now making noise on ‘green tape’.  Oil companies spend $150m per year on lobbying against carbon reduction, $190 m saying they are the good guys, and $115bn on new extraction (3% on low carbon). \nHow ethical is this?\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.7 Activity 1 - Ethical Practices Case Study\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable

The key unethical behaviors mentioned in the paper include:\nFalse advertising – Companies give wrong or misleading information to customers to increase sales.\nExploitation of workers – Some firms underpay workers, give poor working conditions, or ignore labor rights.\nBribery and corruption – Businesses use bribes to win contracts or avoid legal rules.\nEnvironmental violations – Some companies ignore environmental laws and pollute just to cut costs.\nTax evasion – Firms avoid paying taxes through unfair or illegal means.\nThese unethical actions hurt not just the company’s image but also the market and the people. For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems. That’s why I believe ethical business is not only the right thing to do but also important for long-term success.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n28 May 17:09| Last reply 30 May 9:12\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the article by Rai and Deo (2017), it’s clear that some businesses still engage in really questionable behaviour. The paper talks about companies lying to customers through false advertising, treating workers unfairly, and using bribes to get ahead. What stood out to me was how common it still is for businesses to ignore environmental rules or avoid taxes just to save money. These actions might help them in the short term, but they seriously damage trust in the long run. Customers stop buying from brands they don’t believe in, employees become unhappy, and honest businesses find it harder to compete. It also puts a bad image on the whole industry. I think businesses need to realist that ethics and success go hand in hand—cutting corners might work for a while, but it always catches up with them.\n \n I completely agree with what you said about

On the Right and in this stable environment business provides the taxes eg corporation, VAT etc to the government through providing employment and good work leading to growth in the economy.  Through business activities the government reviews how they can protect citizens in society such as through environmental regulations, paternity leave, minimum wage and other employment regulation and interventions.  These are signals from the government that they are looking after citizens and ensuring business protect Society.  However, the government are caught in the middle of conflicting demands in a bipolar situation.\n\nFigure 2:  Government between business and society interests (Crane et al, 2019, p.486)\nTherefore here we can see that business can have significant impact and influence on the implementation of government policies and business influence legitimacy and accountability are questioned.  Business can expect stable legal and economic frameworks, however if these demands interfere too much with their activities and leads to irresponsible lobbying and scrutiny in terms of accountability. \n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.3 Government choice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.3 Government choice\n\nStudy Activity\nSo governments have a choice in where they position themselves.   \nDo you think that the government is:\nPro business?\nFairness to workers?\nFairness to consumers?\nHow to balance these aspects?\nInterventionist or laissez faire?\nCan you think of any examples of each of these different choices that the government has to make?  Make a list of examples.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\n\nThe main ethical consideration arising from this situation is twofold as identified above:\nlegitimacy of business influence;\naccountability (Crane et al.,, 2019)\nBusinesses look to influence to government or public policy through legitimacy of business influences through corporate political activity and they do this through activities such as lobbying, political advertising, financial contributions, legal action and political campaigning.  \nYou will hear in the news how business have paid for government campaigns or have funded political parties in ways to lobby the government. \nFor example one of top Tory Party Donors in the UK in 2022 is JCB who donated over £2.5 million whilst Boris Johnson has been in power.  JCB Chairman has access to Boris Johnson’s top team as part of an elite “advisory board” who lobbied for early relaxation of lockdown measures inn 2020 and tax benefits for high net-worth individuals.  Others have been given public appointments or honours through giving donations.  Therefore business can have a significant influence on the implementation and direction of governmental policies. It is therefore no surprise that the issue of ‘public sector ethics has gained enormous momentum (Dobel 2007).\nIn terms of accountability to the public, one may contend that since the government acts as a representative of society’s interests, the public has a right to be informed about governmental decisions with other constituencies (such as business) and be able to determine whether it is acting in its interests or not.  Both parties are able to influence each other, the main concerns for business ethics are where business has influence on government.  There are numerous ways that business can influence government and Oberman (cited in Getz 1997, p59) distinguishes among different ways, using following criteria as to whether it is:\nThis gives different approaches to influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in 2008-9 as it had so many officials that had worked there from government posts.\nJapan has a tradition known as ‘Amakudari’, which means that Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high profile positions going into private and public sectors.  It means “descent from heaven”.  This example proved that in Japan, many contracts went to 70% of firms with links (no contest) to previous government bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you place these countries in (least corrupt first)?\nUSA\nRwanda\nDenmark\nSomalia\nColombia\nItaly\nUK\nClick here to reveal the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.6 Contemporary issues\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.6 Contemporary issues\n\nDuring the 1980s, the government in UK and USA started to privatise public industries such as telecommunication, rail and utilities for example.   In addition in the 1990s following the end of the USSR and the development of post-soviet transition from communism to capitalism there was massive scale investment in these countries which you have seen is where the growth of globalisation has come from.\nIn 2013, the Post Office in the UK was floated on the stock exchange through selling shares to private investors.  Representations from the firm, Lazard, were paid £1.5m by the government for flotation advice relating to the Post Office.  They followed their own recommendations and bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p to reap a profit of £8.4m.  Is this ethical?    One could argue no and their profit was based on insider information.\nDuring the pandemic we have seen that normal procurement rules were suspended and therefore this was open to cronyism. \nA report by the BMJ in 2021, identified that 1/5th of all UK government contracts contained a “red flag” which were indicators of possible corruption.   These contracts were worth £3.7 bn and it was identified that companies bidding for contracts were channeled through “VIP” or “high priority” channels because of their political connection and 30 contracts were awarded to companies with connections to the Conversative Party.  Is this ethical?\nGlobalization has made companies arguably more powerful than many governments.   Thinking about Amazon which is at no.55 if it was a country – ahead of oil rich Qatar and Walmart is bigger than Belgium.   Globalisation has enabled organisations to develop into poorer countries for example increasing their footprint in many countries, resulting in improving democracy to corrupting failed states to all in between.\nWhat moral duty do they have? \nFor example, Amazon and other organisation are able to avoid one tax regime in favour of another and the issue of trade and tariffs become paramount. \nIncreasingly, action on the environment is global and there is less room to hide.  You have to ask, what is the point of profiting in the next 10 years? \nBusinesses complained for centuries about red tape, and they are now making noise on ‘green tape’.  Oil companies spend $150m per year on lobbying against carbon reduction, $190 m saying they are the good guys, and $115bn on new extraction (3% on low carbon). \nHow ethical is this?\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.7 Activity 1 - Ethical Practices Case Study\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable

The key unethical behaviors mentioned in the paper include:\nFalse advertising – Companies give wrong or misleading information to customers to increase sales.\nExploitation of workers – Some firms underpay workers, give poor working conditions, or ignore labor rights.\nBribery and corruption – Businesses use bribes to win contracts or avoid legal rules.\nEnvironmental violations – Some companies ignore environmental laws and pollute just to cut costs.\nTax evasion – Firms avoid paying taxes through unfair or illegal means.\nThese unethical actions hurt not just the company’s image but also the market and the people. For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems. That’s why I believe ethical business is not only the right thing to do but also important for long-term success.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n28 May 17:09| Last reply 30 May 9:12\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the article by Rai and Deo (2017), it’s clear that some businesses still engage in really questionable behaviour. The paper talks about companies lying to customers through false advertising, treating workers unfairly, and using bribes to get ahead. What stood out to me was how common it still is for businesses to ignore environmental rules or avoid taxes just to save money. These actions might help them in the short term, but they seriously damage trust in the long run. Customers stop buying from brands they don’t believe in, employees become unhappy, and honest businesses find it harder to compete. It also puts a bad image on the whole industry. I think businesses need to realist that ethics and success go hand in hand—cutting corners might work for a while, but it always catches up with them.\n \n I completely agree with what you said about how unethical behavi\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761f1a-20564-Topic_6.docx ---\n6.1 Perception of Facebook and Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.1 Perception of Facebook and Ethics\n\nFacebook was set up by Mark Zuckerberg with the mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and it could be argued that he has achieved this to some extent.  However they have been criticised for the way they use personal data, viewing history and their lack of safety at times. \nPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have pledged to give 99% of their wealth away via their eponymous initiative.  You might have read their letter to their daughter which appeared on Facebook just after she was born, and they also pledged to work towards no disease by the end of the century. \nYou’re probably familiar with Bill and Melinda Gates and their work on AIDS in Africa. \nThese are inspiring examples of how businesspeople use their wealth, created from personal sacrifice, hard work, and innovation, to help others.  However it isn’t always what it seems for example,  Facebook’s company base is in Ireland where corporate tax is 12.5% in comparison to Britain at 20%.  Any money the company has made has been routed from the UK through Ireland resulting in them only paying €3.4m in corporate taxes.  Facebook Ireland makes little profit because it makes huge royalty payments for using Facebook technology to another Irish company called Facebook Holdings Limited which is also based in Ireland, although its tax domicile is in the Cayman Islands which is tax-free.  This tax trick is known as the “double-Irish”.    In 2019 Facebook’s turnover in the UK was £1.6bn.  A relatively miserly 5% profit margin would have resulted in profits of £800m, and yet their declared profits were just £97m.\nHere we have another view of business, one in which the businessperson does all it possibly can to avoid paying what it rightfully should, stripping (for example) the UK of its citizens’ wealth, and stopping our government from tackling  poverty, disease and improving education.  This tax arrangement is said to have ended but we haven’t yet seen how much tax Facebook will pay.\nFacebook are not alone at these practices for example other Tech Giants such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and Cisco Systems have between them only paid £191m in taxes in the UK in 2017.  This was on a combined turnover of £23.42bn and estimated profits of £6.62bn, which would have meant them paying £1.068bn more than they did. \nIt could be argued that Britain’s businesses are sometimes misaligned with those of other stakeholders such as employees, customers, service users and local authorities. \nCo-operatives were established to achieve specific or organisational goals to share both risk and reward which means that they are more democratic and accountable and can’t sell equity on capital markets to influence shareholding conglomerates.  Recent studies have shown them to be more enduring and resilient in the face of market dispution, more profitable and more productive (Co-ops unleashed, 2022).\nHowever Britain’s top five co-operatives paid more in tax in 2016 than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks combined as shown in the image below:\n\nFigure 1:  Comparison of tax contributions (SEUK, 2018)\n\nIt is worth just reiterating what we mean by some key concepts in the economy and pointing to some differences.   As you will be aware the economy is split into two sectors –\nPrivate and Public:\nPrivate sector - Independent entities, owned by individuals or shareholders, and who are dependent on customers with outcome of being profit-driven\nPublic sector - Part of a larger whole and owned by the state, national or local. They are answerable to government and voters and have a clear social purpose\nPrivate companies are separate bodies.  They may of course take multiple forms, as we see from mergers and acquisitions all the time, but the very term corporation is derived from the Latin corpus which means body.  They are owned by one person, a few people, many people, or even by other corporations in the form of corporate investors etc.  They may be sole traders, owned and managed by one person, or the management may be appointed to run the company on behalf of the shareholders.  They are of course subject to the law of the land, but their duty is to shareholders, and their performance of that duty is dependent on how well they serve their customers. This generates profit, which is the primary purpose.\nWe can all think of public sector bodies, for example, the Job Centre, the local hospital, even the police or army.  Using that latter example, while the army is distinct from the navy or the air force, they are expected to pursue common objectives.  The armed forces collectively are also part of the state, along with all its other constituents, and they are all meant to be pulling in the same direction.  That direction is decided not by the market, but by governments, which are, of course, elected every 5 years, or more frequently at local level.  They have in common that private profit should not be their primary purpose.  However lean or efficient they might be, the profit (or savings made) is recycled elsewhere in the system rather than shared amongst a few owners.\nMost countries in the world operate a 'mixed economy', consisting of for-profit enterprises, and state-owned organisations.  These two parts of the economy are often referred to as the private and public sectors and are calibrated in different proportions in different states.  For example, in Denmark around 35% of jobs are in the public sector, while in South Korea the figure is only 7.6% (OECD, 2015). \nIn the UK, around 28 million people work in the private sector, which is almost 84% of the entire workforce (ONS, 2018).  There are 5.7 million businesses, which range in size from one person operations ('sole traders') to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) which employ from 10-250 people, up to large national and international corporations.  However, an additional 'third' sector also exists, made up of organisations and associations which are both separate from government and motivated by social objectives rather than private profit.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\nv6.2 The Third Sector\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.2 The Third Sector\n\nSo let’s compare third sector organisations (TSOs) with other sectors, using the features we looked at just now. \nThey are independent of the state, although they might get some funding from local or the national government, or they may be contracted by the NHS to do some work.  They are subject to the law as we all are.  But the government cannot (or should not) tell TSOs what to do. \nSo who owns them?\nThe confusing answer is that for the most part, no-one does, and everyone does. \nIf you look at charities, they are generally overseen by a board of what are called trustees.  They are responsible for directing things, and liable if things go wrong, but they don’t usually get paid, and they don’t share in any profit or surplus.  By the way, day to day management and operations are carried out by paid staff.  It’s not all voluntary. \nBusinesses answer to customers, the government to voters, TSOs to a diverse range of stakeholders, who can have a financial interest such as donors, grant givers, consumers (if they have shops, say) or businesses (if they sell services), even people who are about to die and make a bequest.  But they also answer to communities, and above all to the people or cause they serve.  A charity for disabled adults which wins substantial funding, runs efficiently, and employs dozens of staff will still potentially fail if they don’t serve their beneficiaries properly.\nAbove all, TSOs are motivated by this ‘serve’ mentality.  Social aims such as relief of poverty, protecting the environment, widening access to education, promoting healthy lifestyles, etc. They can’t lose money, or they’ll fail, but making a profit is not their purpose.\nThree key words for the constituents of this sector:\nCharity\nSocial Enterprises (recently rebranded Co-op group is our largest in this country), and\nVoluntary Organisations – the thousands of small entities like sports clubs, allotment societies, self-help groups, tenant’s associations and so on.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\n\n“The third sector includes organisations that:\nExist primarily for a social purpose\nAre independent of the state\nRe-invest financial surpluses in their services\nThe boundaries with the public and private sectors are not clear-cut and over time, organisations move across the boundaries.” \nThis is from Mike Hudson’s book Managing Without Profit. \nTraces history of charity (from a Greek word meaning favour, grace, kindness), which he argues goes back to earliest civilisations, whether it’s in Ancient Egypt, where ferries gave free passage to poor people, the Jewish or Muslim traditions of donating a proportion of your income to the needy, or Christian monks establishing the first hospitals here in England. \nIn many ways the first golden era for charity and philanthropy was the 19th Century, when many ‘household name’ charities were first established (Salvation Army, Barnardo’s, the RNLI, RSPCA, the Red Cross).  This continued up to the 1940s, when government (in the war and after) sought to replace many welfare services previously provided by charity.  Since the 1970s this process has been reversed, and the third sector delivers many public sector contracts, and had an income of over £100 bn in 2008.\nHudson points out the contested nature of the sector’s boundaries.  I would disagree with him, for example, that social enterprises form part of the private sector, as they are driven by social purpose and don’t distribute profits privately.\n\n“A useful way to define the third sector (and social economy) is that it comprises organisations where ‘shares’ of social wealth) are allocated to people in proportion to their needs and activities rather than property (private) or political (public) rights.” - A second definition from Ridley-Duff and Bull, 2011: p17\n\nRidley-Duff and Bull take a more wide-ranging, academic, and radical approach.  They highlight the fact that charitable activity predated the existence of the capitalist system, which only became properly established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nThey also point up two tensions within the third sector:\nNon-profit approach based primarily on giving, versus the ‘more than profit’ approach where SEs trade but do good things with their profits.\nSome organisations, most notably but not exclusively co-operatives, are based on principles of democratic control by members. For example a disability charity where the strategy is set by and for its beneficiaries or service users.  Others are run by one group of people for the good of others, with less democratic input from those they serve.\nThey set social purpose as the key definition, but neglect to mention independence explicitly.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.4 So what's a charity?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.4 So what's a charity?\n\nLet’s start with a charity.  Charity legislation in England goes back to 1603, and there are charities which still exist today which go back still further – there’s an alms house in Winchester which has been going since 1132. \nRoyal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) started in 1868.  Their purpose in a nutshell relates to the welfare of blind and partially sighted people, and the prevention of blindness.  Last year they spent over £123m which puts them in just about the top 20 in the UK.  They helped 17,000 people via sight loss advisers, over 60,000 with general advice, 12,000 with welfare advice, provided 20,000 talking books, and campaigned for safer streets, among other things.  They have 1500 employees and 4800 volunteers resulting in a wage bill of about £60m, and it is confirmed that the CEO earns around £150,000.\nSo charities can be big business. \nIn football club terms RNIB is like Everton or West Ham, in high street terms, a White Stuff.\n\nTopic 6\n6.5 Social Enterprises\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.5 Social Enterprises\n\n\nThe difference between social enterprise and charity is that social enterprises get most of their income from trading, but they are still motivated by social impact more than private profit.  And here’s examples of a social enterprise or two. \nLighthouse furniture is in Towieland, Brentwood.  They stop furniture going to landfill and provide low-cost furniture for low-income families so having two social aims.  They have just over 800k turnover, 80 odd employees and volunteers, and dramatic growth as they’ve doubled in size in 5 years.\nQuadrant here in Chelmsford is part of Chelmsford Star Co-operative, which has a £100m (Like a Burnley level) turnover retail co-operative owned by its customers.  They are committed to co-operative principles including democracy (members elect the board) and supporting the local community (equivalent of 20% of profits donated to good causes).\n \nConfusingly social enterprises can be charities too.  Lighthouse is one.  But Chelmsford Star isn’t.\nThere are some statistics below:\nYou can see that charity numbers, at least in E&W are fairly static, social enterprises are growing in number (and that growth is partly reflected in growth in co-ops). \nWe can’t leave this section with introducing food backs which have grown considerably across the UK particularly in 2022 and the cash crisis.  Food banks have seen their donations skyrocket by 5000% a month in 2020 with the average donation of approximately £1900.  The needs for foodbanks has grown across the UK and those that need access to this service can through vetting procedures.  This is an area of social enterprise that has significantly increased over the last few years.\nEton College\n\nEton College is a school in Eton, Berkshire in England and was founded in 1440 by Henry VI.  It has famously been attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, and other senior conservative prime ministers, for example.  However they have designated registered charity status.  Their charitable income includes fees, as these are raised in support of their purpose: education. \nThe fees are  £12,354 per term and therefore should they be a charity? \nFees, then generated £42m for the school and it has 646 employees and NO volunteers.  During the year 277 boys (21%) received fee reductions; 70 of these boys paid no fees at all. The equivalent figures for the previous year were 277 and 64. the amount spent on fee remission increased from £5,773k to £6,084k with the average award remaining 64% of the full fee.  It has £300m of assets, mainly property and investments.\nIn comparison, the Royal National Lifebook Institution (RNLI) is one of the biggest charities in the UK.  They are funded through donations, grants, legacies and account for £174m of its income of £192m.  It has 2200 employees and 33,000 volunteers.  It has saved 329 lives and helped 42,000 people in 2019.\nWhy should a charity do this?\nIs there any reason why the same could not apply to government bodies too? \nCSOs have a tradition of campaigning for legal reform, and against unfair policies or laws.  However, there are strict limits on charities, for example, campaigning for a particular party in an election\nHere are some ways in which CSOs take on this role:\nIndirect action often takes the form of research, communications, information, raising awareness about activities which are not seen as ethical.  So for example, an anti-obesity charity would campaign in the media and social media against fast food or soft drinks companies, as part of its general work. \nDirect action is riskier, can be violent (unlikely) or non-violent in nature.  If violent it is more likely to be property than people who get damaged.  But a group called SHAC (NOT registered charity) attacked Huntingdon Life Sciences with threats, violence and vandalism. They only stopped in 2014, after 15 years.  More often it’s like we see here with the Greenpeace boat in an earlier lesson.  However some of the ways they can cause disruption is through demonstrations, marches, letters, occupations, and boycotts.\nBoycotts are a form of ethical consumption, and organised refusal to buy services or goods.  So they:\nChange a policy\nGet a buzz around or against a company more generally\nCommunicate disapproval\nOr punish the company in their pockets\nIs this always a negative?  Can it be good for companies in the long run?\nCSOs or TSOs can challenge government as well as business. \nAnd of course the government can regulate and control business and TSOs in return.  However business complain of red tape, and charities find some of these regulations as e over burdensome such as having to report requirements attached to funding.  They also support and enable TSOs to thrive and here are some of the things being ‘traded’ between government and the sector. \nThe government is committed to tackling obesity, and charities exist with the same agenda.  They may not always agree, but some policy will chime with TSO campaigns. \nThe government can also provide a legislative framework broadly supportive of TSOs, which TSOs can support back.  If the government promotes volunteering, TSOs and CSOs can host events through providing volunteers.  This helps the government meet its own objectives (and maybe save money?)\nFinancially, in various ways: through buying their services; granting funds for projects or research; and lending, perhaps via social finance (more in a minute) .  In return, public trust (charities trusted more than govt, still), agility, flexibility, social innovation, access to ‘hard to reach’ people.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.6 Government Policy \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.6 Government Policy \n\nThe government launched Big Society Capital (BSC) in April 2012. Its purpose is to provide wholesale funding (investments, repayable) for charities and social enterprises to grow in scale, use as working capital, and buy assets to generate income.  Started with £120m, made up of ‘sorry money’ from UK banks, and money from dormant bank accounts.  By 2015, over 250 charities and social enterprise had accessed finance (from intermediaries) that BSC provided, which resulted in a total of £195m, of which BSC accounted for £68m from its own cash.\nThe conservative government proposed the Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support Bill) in 2021 and is currently passing through parliament.  This bill was to assess the benefits and effectiveness of TSOs and provide to support organisation’s function.    You can read more about this proposed bill here - Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support) Bill (parliament.uk)Links to an external site.. \nThe National Citizen Service (NCS) encourages socially meaningful volunteering and participation by young people.  Piloted by a social enterprise with 100 odd people in 2009, the government adopted it in 2010 and since then over 200,000 have signed up.  Clearly has an impact on the third sector.  It was mainly set up to encourage 16–17-year-olds to volunteer during the summer after their GCSEs.  \nThe conservative government introduced the “big society” plan in 2010 to empower communities, however it was ill-fated and was disbanded mainly due to the fact that it lacked funding and support.   The government now wants people to have a say at local level in terms of getting better facilities using a cross sector approach which is not just up to local government.  However for the social sector there is no big new pot of money and the total spend due to austerity measures has been in significant decline and many community projects have been abandoned. \nThe government launched the Social Value Act which came into force in 2013 with aim of ensuring wider social, economic and environmental benefits.  This allowed the government to ensure that contracts would be awarded to organisations where their social values could be evaluated, and the government departments would then report on the social impact of these contracts.  The Social Value Model provides a consistent approach for the departments to streamline and standardise the procurement process. \nLet’s now think about how business interacts more positively with CSOs.  Here are some ways.\n\nFigure 3:  How Business interacts with CSOs.\nOn the right of this image are some of the ‘paybacks’ the third sector can offer for these interactions such as through joint ventures and the sense of ‘exchange’ is greater and more formalised in the bottom half of this image. \nWe’re familiar with the great entrepreneurs and giving.  \nCarnegie was a captain of industry or robber baron depending on your viewpoint, made a fortune in steel in the 19th century in the US, sold out for $480 million, which is $310 billion today.  One of the richest men who ever lived, gave $350 million away.   He killed strikers in his steel plants and was responsible for the worst manmade disaster in US history at the South Fork Dam.  However, he built 3000 libraries, a university and his final $30 million was donated in his will to institutions, charities and pensioners.  \nHow do we place this along with modern individual figures like Gates and Zuckerberg in the context of business ethics? \nMore recently, an expectation is that companies themselves ‘give something back’.  For example, a firm has an office in Chelmsford, where its Foundation is also based.  It had profits in 2018 of £121m and it spent less than £1m on the foundation, although technically they don’t have to give it.  A further example is Omaze which is a fundraising platform which has enabled over 300 charities to raise over £100m.  They give back by doing world-changing work such as creating after school programmes for 17,000 children in Los Angeles or through raising funds for disaster relive in California fires.   Each year the entire organisation takes a break from their office jobs for an annual day of service where they volunteer with a local non-profit organisation and give back to the community.  Organisations in the UK are also doing this, and they reward their staff for community based voluntary activities.\nWhere would this fit in ethical theories? \nVery much a teleological approach – there is a purpose behind it.  You could say it was egotistical – the company doing good for its own purposes.   Hasn’t even been completely demonstrated that (e.g.) profits are linked to CSR.  So why bother? It can help with long term revenues, reduced costs, managing risk and uncertainty and maintaining the social licence to operate.\nCompanies who are seen as socially responsible might attract more customers, and irresponsible ones are likely to lose them, and their employees might be more productive.  For example, a focus on sustainability leads to reduced costs by saving energy or cutting down on waste and acting responsibly, and being perceived to do so, can reduce government interventions, and potentially prevent bad practice and associated costs.  Also it allows the company to operate, and potentially contributes to a stable, peaceful, and equitable environment in which to do so. \n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.7 Activity 1 – What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.7 What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\n\nDiscussion Activity - Contribute to the discussion\nThird sector and charitable organisations such as food banks have grown through Covid and current cash crisis in the UK.  Many governments funded projects are short-term and output focussed which fails to meet the needs or support citizens and communities and therefore sustainability is key for these organisations.\nThinking about your own experience of third sector organisations or through research how do you think Third Sector organisations can diversify their income, work more agile and work more with government policymakers to improve the lives of people in crisis?\nPost your comments  to the forum and respond to one of your peer’s posts.\n\nTopic 6\nReply\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n28 May 20:59| Last reply 30 May 9:07\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nDiversifying Income and Building Sustainability in the Third Sector\nThe growth of third sector and charitable organisations such as food banks during COVID-19 and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis reflects a deep and increasing need for community-based support systems. However, their heavy reliance on short-term, output-focused government funding undermines long-term impact and sustainability. From both research and experience, there are several ways in which these organisations can become more financially resilient, agile, and influential in policymaking:\n1. Diversifying Income Streams\nTo reduce reliance on time-limited public grants, third sector organisations can:\nDevelop social enterprises: Many charities are setting up business arms that offer goods or services while reinvesting profits into their core mission. For example, The Trussell Trust has partnered with retailers and tech firms to run donation-linked campaigns.\nCorporate partnerships: Strategic, values-aligned partnerships with private companies can provide long-term income and resource sharing.\nIndividual giving and legacy donations: Investment in digital fundraising platforms and awareness campaigns has helped some charities significantly grow their donation base.\nReference: NCVO (2023) highlights that charities with diverse income sources were more financially stable during the pandemic.\n(Source: National Council for Voluntary Organisations – www.ncvo.org.uk)\n2. Becoming More Agile\nAgility is key in responding to crises. This includes:\nInvesting in digital infrastructure: Enabling remote support services, managing data more effectively, and enhancing communication.\nCollaborative working models: Pooling resources with other third sector groups or local authorities to avoid duplication and increase efficiency.\nUpskilling volunteers and staff: So they can adapt quickly to changing demands and service needs.\n3. Working With Government Policymakers\nThird sector organisations must play a more active role in influencing social policy:\nData-driven advocacy: Charities often hold unique frontline data about poverty, food insecurity, and housing. Sharing this with policymakers can shape better-targeted interventions.\nInclusion in long-term planning: Instead of being seen as emergency responders, charities should be embedded in local and national resilience strategies.\nDemonstrating outcomes: Providing robust evidence of impact, beyond output metrics, helps justify sustained investment and policy support.\nConclusion\nFor the third sector to continue meeting rising community needs, especially during economic hardship, it must move towards income diversification, operational agility, and proactive policy engagement. Only then can it provide sustainable, long-term support to the most vulnerable.\nReference; \nNational Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO, 2023).\nThey provide insights and data on how UK charities managed through COVID-19 and economic uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of income diversification for financial sustainability.\nCitation:\nNCVO.

However, one of the biggest challenges is that many of these organisations rely on short-term or project-based government funding, which often limits their long-term impact and planning.\nTo move forward, I believe third sector organisations must shift their focus towards resilience and long-term capacity-building, rather than just reacting to crises.\nOne way to strengthen their stability is by building community-led income models. This means not only accepting donations but involving local communities in creating solutions — like community cafés, repair shops, or thrift stores — that generate income while serving a social purpose. These types of micro-initiatives empower people locally and reduce dependency on external funding.\nAnother approach is for these organisations to build stronger alliances with local authorities and other nonprofits. Often, many organisations work in the same area but separately. By collaborating more closely and sharing resources like office space, training, or volunteers, they can reduce costs and strengthen service delivery.\nIn terms of policy influence, the third sector should use evidence and data from the people they serve to push for policy change. Many smaller charities don’t realise how valuable their on-the-ground insights are. By submitting reports, joining local policy networks, and attending public consultations, they can make sure the voices of those in crisis are heard at government level.\nFinally, third sector organisations should invest in staff development and digital skills. Many charities still struggle with technology and rely heavily on a small number of staff or volunteers. Training staff in digital tools, fundraising strategy, and public advocacy can make the organisation more confident and effective in any situation.\nReferences\nNCVO. (2022). Civil Society Almanac.

Many people rely on these organisations for basic needs, such as food and shelter. However, one of the biggest challenges they face is sustainability, especially when their funding depends on short-term government projects.\nTo make third sector organisations more sustainable, I believe they should focus on three key areas: diversifying income, working more flexibly, and partnering with government policymakers.\nFirst, to diversify income, charities can go beyond traditional donations and apply models like social enterprise, where they sell goods or services to fund their main goals. Many also benefit from corporate partnerships, local fundraising, grants, and even online subscriptions. For example, some food banks now partner with local grocery stores to collect regular food donations.\nSecond, these organisations should work more agilely. That means using digital tools, responding faster to local needs, and reducing red tape. For example, during the pandemic, many local charities used WhatsApp and Zoom to coordinate services quickly. Using flexible systems also helps them adapt when funding or community needs change suddenly.\nFinally, it is essential that third sector organisations have a voice in public policy. Instead of just reacting to crises, they should be part of the conversation when new social policies are being created. This can be done through research, case studies, or involving people with lived experience in meetings with government officials. Building these relationships can lead to long-term solutions, not just emergency aid.\nIf third sector organisations can build more reliable income, adapt faster, and be part of shaping policy, they will not only survive but grow stronger in the long run.\nReferences\nMacmillan, R.

Most of these organisations depend on brief projects for funding which sometimes prevents them from having a lasting effect. As a result, organizations in the third sector should increase their funding, adapt work practices and regularly engage with policy experts. A good way to increase income is to blend public money, social business, campaigns for raising funds, partnering with companies and digital giving. Crowdfunding and teaming up with supermarkets have been key to The Trussell Trust in supporting their food banks for years (The Trussell Trust, 2021). Thanks to digitalisation, charities can serve more people and raise more money. It is also very important to be agile. Hence, governmental processes should be updated by replacing strict structures with agile systems that emphasise making decisions fast, more use of technology and greater service closeness to citizens (Macmillan, 2020). The use of agile strategies helps third sector organisations respond quickly to the changing needs of their communities. Partnership with government officials helps achieve significant changes in a business. Together with service users, some organisations now work with policymakers to design new solutions to poverty and exclusion (Clark et al., 2022).\nAll in all, sustainability for the third sector over the long term is achieved when organisations have varied incomes, can adapt to changes and influence public policy through working jointly.\nSources\nClark, J., Kane, D., Wilding, K. & Bass, P.

Diversity\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.1 The business case for Diversity\n\nMaking a business case for diversity has provided justification to organisations for best practices and how it can drive progress and improve companies bottom line.  The links between diversity and financial improvement has strengthened over the last few years and organisations that have incorporated “social listening” of their employee online reviews shows the importance of inclusion and why companies should pay attention to diversity on moral grounds of fairness and equal opportunity.  However the report from Orgiane Georgea and Aneeta Rattan in June 2022, outlined why organisations should stop making the business case for diversity as they found that this approach makes underrepresented job candidates less interested to work with an organisation and it undermines Diversity and Inclusion effort.  The authors suggested that a ”fairness” case is more effective and is based on “moral grounds”.  Through their research they found that 80% of organisations used the business case to justify diversity with less than 5% using the fairness case.  They also found that:\n“Our statistically robust findings show that underrepresented participants who read a business case for diversity on average anticipated feeling 11% less sense of belonging to the company, were 16% more concerned that they would be stereotyped at the company, and were 10% more concerned that the company would view them as interchangeable with other members of their identity group, compared to those who read a fairness case.”\nUltimately the business case for diversity can have negative impacts on underrepresented groups as it can undermine diversity efforts and therefore a fairness case is more effective. \n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\nv7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\n\nReports have identified that Women and BAME communities are under-represented in full-time work and leadership roles across UK organisations who need to explore wider talent pools to draw candidates from throughout the community and understanding diverse markets and clients.  One example in 2020 was Marks and Spencer who reviewed its workforce and identified that it needed to reflect a truly diverse and inclusive environment through its employment practices, its retailing practices including ranges it carries and its store layouts and as a business with stores in the communities.  Marks and Spencer had a large population of retail assistants who were white females and they identified that they needed to more reflective to represent their diverse customer base through recruiting, retaining diverse talent through setting targets for ethnic minorities and women in management.\nAnother initiative across organisations has been to increase the number of women into executive roles at Board level.  During 2021 40% of UK FTSE 100 board positions were held by women compared with 12.5% just over 10 years ago.  (Gov.uk, 2022).  Having a diverse workforce can generate higher profits and even a 10% increase in women in organisation has been linked to 3% in increase in profits.\nThe government has introduced legislation in the form of Gender pay Gap reporting for organisations with over 250 employees who have to report annually on their gender pay gap with the aim of helping reduce the gap between what women and men are paid.  Some organisations have set targets to reduce this imbalance with a large construction company setting targets to increase the number of women they employ to earning over £40,000 a year to at least 25% by 2025.  Visit the equality and human rights act and read the Closing the Gender Pay Gap report. \nTraditionally the typical family model has been the women as care giver providing care for the children and being employed in part-time roles, allowing them to work around childcare for example with the man being the breadwinner going out to work.  Many leaders in organisations have been white strong men.  Thinking about governments we have seen only one black leader in the USA and two women prime ministers in the UK, which does not represent our diverse communities.\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n7.3 So what are the solutions?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.3 So what are the solutions?\n\nOne of the solutions is to introduce Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging Programmes.  Organisations such as the UK Supreme Court have created diversity, inclusion and belonging strategies to help them reflect the society we live in and to respect the differences and supporting equal opportunity for everyone.  This means doing the right thing and that every member of staff within the court feels they belong through contributing their views which will be valued.   \nYou can read more about their strategy as - https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/uksc-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-strategy-2021.pdfLinks to an external site. \nSome of the ways that organisations can introduce these programmes is to ensure that they attract, recruit and develop diverse talent and work with under-represented groups to retain diverse workforce.  Development of inclusive leaders is important, and organisations need to ensure these have the skills, confidence and behaviours to build positive relations that enables all employees to thrive.  Through people analytics and data collection relating to diversity will help understand and develop aspects of diversity in the workplace.  By being an employer of choice and taking action to be inclusive, supportive and respectful will ensure that employees wellbeing matters and it is a brilliant experience for all.  Finally organisations that support accessibility for all in promoting education and outreach work will promote themselves to others. \n\nTopic 7\n7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\n\nEqual opportunities legislation is generally targeted at ensuring procedural justice is promoted and it prohibits discrimination against ANYONE.  However Affirmative Action programmes on the other hand, deliberately attempt to advance groups under-represented in the workforce through redistributive, or retributive justice.\nOrganisations need to ensure that they have fair:\nRecruitment policies\njob criteria\nTraining programmes for discriminated groups\npromotion procedures to senior positions for discriminated groups\nDiscrimination as the solution to discrimination?  Positive discrimination is generally unlawful in the UK for example where an employer wants to recruit a person specifically based on their protected characteristics such as Race for example.  However the previous Met Police Chief Cressida Dick asked for the law to be changed so that their recruitment processes could favour ethnic minority candidates over white applications as currently the force does not represent the community and nearly 8000 complaints of racism have been received.  The Met Police want to recruit a diverse workforce that represents their community; however this may mean they are not selecting the best candidates and having  targets to recruit higher ethnic participation is good may mean accepting lower standards.\n\nTopic 7\n7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \n\nIndividuals are living longer than previously with life expectancy for example in the UK which has increased from about 72 in the 1960s to 81.2 years in 2019.  This means that individuals are likely to work longer and therefore organisations need to review the opportunities for the older generation.  Thinking about some job roles, how realistic that someone in their 70s can be an active firefighter or prison warden?  Therefore organisations need to think about different job roles and how individuals can manage their work and expectancy.  Individuals will be less likely to be able to retire at 65 as they may not have the required savings to provide a reasonable income and research has suggested that many individuals currently in their mid-40s may need to work into their early to mid-70s to cover this financial shortfall. \nThis image from Gratton and Scott (2017) study shows some of the changes for example historically individuals went to school, work and then retired.  However now they have multistages of life, they go to school they may work as an employee, or they may look to mix this with self-employment or even have a portfolio of work which is paid and unpaid which they may take into retirement.  Therefore organisations need to consider how they can change corporate policies and HR policies and practices to support healthy and prosperous longevity.\n\nFigure 1:  Changing Ideas of Wellbeing at/about Work (Gratton & Scott, 2017)\nThe world has changed and how we are introduced to different “generations” in society.  Generations is the sociological notion of being born across a span of about 20 years, for example:\nGen Z (zoomers) born mid to late 1990s to early 2010\nGen Y (millennials) born between 1981 and 1994/6\nGen X born between 1965 and 1981\nBaby boomers born between 1945 and 1964\nThe literature is clear, the statistical differences across most measures on common work issues/styles is so small that more research should be focusing on generational similarities and not differences.   Each of these different generations may exist at the same time and therefore how do organisations build gaps between the way they work and communicate?   Gen X tend to have values of ambition and strong ability to work hard where Gen Y are competitive in an extremely advanced world.  Gen Z grew up with tablets and smartphones and digital experiences are crucial to their DNA.  They are able to multi-task be independent and can be demanding in the workplace and if they are not engaged, they will leave.\nSo what can an employer do to improve its working practices covering these generational differences? \nEmployers need to develop wellbeing policies and procedures to ensure that employees are engaged and thrive through reduced stress, anger and health problems.  The relationship between engagement and wellbeing is vital because when people experience work influences their lives outside work and overall wellbeing influence their lives at work.\nGallup have produced a report which identified that wellbeing is crucial for business.  You can read it here:  https://www.gallup.com/workplace/313067/employees-aren-thriving-business-struggling.aspxLinks to an external site.. \nThe report was based on positive psychology, and it identified 34 themes based on the fact that the individual spends approximately 81,396 hours at work.  Organisations now report their employee engagement to customers, and they suggested that those not thriving in their lives are more vulnerable and add risk to the organisation in terms of burnout and stress.   They also identified that 52% of workers who were thriving had less missed absence and struggling employees had higher levels of depression and anxiety resulting in big differences in productivity.  The latest 2022 report identified that global engagement was still low and employee stress was at a new all-time high with over 44% of employees experiencing daily stress.  The report also identified that the best places in the world to be an employee were the US And Candidate with being the No1s for living comfortably, employee engagement, job opportunities and second for wellbeing.\nHow can organisations improve wellbeing?\nPerkbox in 2020, identified the following different ways that an organisation can improve employee wellbeing:\nProvide employee assistance programme\nHelp employees work towards long-term goals\nSet friendly fitness challenges\nIntroduce wellbeing-based employee benefits\nArrange regular get-togethers\nIntroduce designated wellbeing leaders\nEncourage real breaks\nCreate a comfortable work environment\nReward and recognise great work\nEncourage staff to take responsibility for their own wellbeing\nConsider offering unlimited holidays\nCreate stronger employee-manager relationships\nArrange wellbeing workshops\nMake it easy for your staff to make healthy choices\nTweak the working routine to work for staff\nSurvey teams to find out which of the wellbeing initiatives are working\nThinking about our own organisation which of these initiatives do they offer and how effective do you think they are?\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762188-20564-Topic_8_.docx ---\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. The business of business is business’.\n‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’.\n\nHowever, only human beings have moral responsibility for their actions; corporations aren’t human beings, despite the name and the sense of being a body.  Doing otherwise than acting for shareholders was for him a betrayal and theft from shareholders’ dividends.\nTherefore, as long as business complies with society’s laws and regulations for business, their only responsibility is to act in the best interest of shareholders and businesses aren’t elected, and managers aren’t trained to decide what’s in society’s best interests.\nFriedman was part of the Chicago School of Economics, associated with monetarist policy, reduction in public spending. Arguably, with his ideological opponent JM Keynes, the most influential economist of the 20th century.  This article is ‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’ and if you look on Canvas you can read it in full.  It was an essay published over 50 years ago in (1970) and took issue with what he saw as a distressing trend among corporations to worry about social responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.

responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.2 Corporate Social Responsibility\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.2 Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCSR has become the widely accepted term for when companies have a “corporate internal decision structure which directs decisions in line with predetermined goals” – strategy (French 1979) and that organisations “manifest a set of beliefs and values that lay out what is generally regarded as right or wrong in the corporation”  organizational culture (Moore 1999).  There is a sense that they are entities which can have a social impact, and that therefore this should be positive as far as possible and hence CSR is a worldwide phenomenon, above all though in the US.\n‘Semantics aside, if corporations are to formulate and implement strategies in turbulent environments, theories of strategy must have concepts, such as the wide sense of stakeholder, which allows the analysis of all external forces and pressures whether they are friendly or hostile.’  Edward Freeman (1984)\n“Corporate social responsibility is concerned with the ways in which an organization exceeds the minimum obligations to stakeholders specified through regulation and corporate governance” (Johnson and Scholes, 2002, p. 247)\nIn 2008, Banerjee put forward the moral and logical case for CSR in that:\nCorporations are powerful social actors that cause social problems and produce social goods\nCorporations should think beyond making money\nCorporations should behave in an ethical manner\nCorporations should be involved with the community they operate within\nThey can not escape their responsibilities and they must pay attention to social and environmental issues.  Organisations must demonstrate a high level of integrity and transparency across their organisations and use sustainable resources for the greater good.  They should also enhance social welfare for providing community support through philanthropy and other means. \nCarroll’s CSR pyramid is a framework for explaining how and why organisations should take social responsibility and highlights four of the most important types of responsibility for organisation:\nEconomic responsibility\nLegal responsibility\nEthical responsibility\nPhilanthropic responsibility\n\nFigure 1:  Carroll’s CSR Pyramid (ResearchGate, 2022).\nEconomic responsibility is the foundation of the pyramid and structure and is fundamental to survive in business and profitability and compliance with the law are important for social responsibility through producing goods and services that society needs at a fair price with employees who do their jobs safely and fairly.\nLegal responsibility relates to compliance with the law such as minimum wage for example across both national and local regulations.  It also regulates behaving as company citizens, meeting legal obligations through supplying goods and services that meet minimum legal requirements.\nEthical responsibility relates to embracing activities in an ethical manner and consistent with society’s expectations and respecting evolving and ethical standards that are adopted by society.  It also reflects preventing infringement of ethical standards and acknowledging that business integrity and ethical behaviour go beyond compliance with laws and regulations. \nPhilanthropic responsibility relates to voluntary and discretionary activities and practices of business such as giving back to the community through volunteer work.\nIn 1991, Donna Wood identified different approaches to Corporate Social Performance in terms of:\nHaving social policies - explicit statements of company values, goals; and social targets; emission / recycling targets.\nLeading to social programs - Activities and instruments to measure achievements of social policies.\nWith measurable social impacts - Concrete changes the corporation has achieved towards its CSR policies; although it can be difficult to measure – ‘soft’, qualitative data\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/258977.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab2fdd8176c1e350c1c53247f5931f875Links to an external site.\nWe have seen in earlier lessons how the UN is supporting global change.  Through the Global Compact campaign the UN has enacted 10 ethical principles for long – term success.  The image below shows the 10 different principles:\n\nFigure 2:  UN 10 Ethical Principles - https://www.atlantica.com/web/en/sustainability/united-nations-global-compact-ungc/Links to an external site.\nThese principles are not legally binding or mandatory or enforced but reflect the way they should be working.  It has been suggested that the Global Compact is “bluewashing” which refers to the fact that few companies are actually complying with these principles.    Bluewashing is bad because consumers tend to think that companies are more ethical and socially responsible than they are as they use their membership of Global Compact as an easy way out.  Bluewashing is focussing on human rights and labour conditions and where companies are required to submit reports.  Between 2005-2013 many thousands of companies did not comply.  Companies have said they prefer voluntary codes of conduct.\nIn addition to Bluewashing there is “greenwashing”.   This means, a strategy where companies over-emphasise positive aspects of their environmental records to mask their actual performance’ (Marquis & Qian, 2013). “At the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, a group of NGOs held a Greenwash Academy Awards event to criticize companies that falsely promote themselves as environmentally responsible and to “recognize these companies for what they are: hypocrites.” (Lyon and Maxwell, 2006, p.4) \nHere are some examples of Greenwashing in action:\n‘BP Going Green’ and ‘Beyond Petroleum’…\nThis was a multi-million-dollar advertising campaigns where they were promoting commitment to alternative energy sources.\n‘Shifting from oil to energy companies’ and they suggested ‘From the Earth to the Sun, and everything in between’ and were awarded ‘Golden Paintbrush’ by Greenpeace in 2008\nGlobal Financial Crisis where BP shut its alternative energy HQ and Shell stopped investing in wind / solar.\nSince then there has been some progress due to shareholder pressures.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.3 CSR Choices: Shareholders and Stakeholders \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.3 CSR Choices: Shareholders and Stakeholders \n\nCorporate social responsibility depends on whether ethical behaviour is rewarded, and/or unethical behaviour is punished or the legitimacy of the stakeholders’ claims.  This means that the leaders’ values are important, and pressures are placed on leaders to act ethically and not unethically.   For example, when stakeholders needs and goals clash, then the most powerful tend to win.\nThis is problematic because CSR a ‘northern’ / developed world phenomenon and  the ‘Ideas developed in New York, not Sao Paolo’.  This means that power and influence of customers  in developed countries is greater than workers in developing countries and the interests of customers in developed countries are  different to interests of workers in developing countries,  CSR programs directives of ‘west’ and companies’ choses CSR goals, employees have to follow. \n\nFigure 3:  Stakeholder Map\nIf there is conflict is there a business case for CSR?  Can organisations really show causation between CSR and profits?  Good corporate citizenship can be related to good financial performance in terms of brand reputation and be attractive to prospective and current employees and we have seen earlier poor examples such as Primark where poor practice impacted their brand.   \nThe image below shows how the firms’ actions and financial returns influence primary stakeholders and society:\n\nFigure 4:  Mapping the business cases\nThe dotted line at the lowest part of the image shows how a firms actions link directly to financial returns and therefore shareholders take actions to remain viable.  The positive signs show how stakeholder theory reflects on firms’ financial returns which are enhanced through actions that improve the relationship with its primary stakeholder.   The dashed line at the top represents the complicated link between firms’ actions and financial returns with society.   Therefore the better the firms’ actions to better society but does it impact financial viability? \nThis article explains this in more detail and gives some good examples as to the conflict between society and stakeholders - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0007650316660044Links to an external site.  The business Case for CSR:  A critique and an indirect path forward, Barnett, 2016.\nIt could be argued that the freedom to engage in entrepreneurial activities is in itself socially responsible and can bring many benefits to society including jobs, training and revenue for suppliers.  We have seen poor practices from companies where they have dumped waste into the oceans, or their production processes pollute the air.  Apart from affecting the local community this could also impact the employees and put them at risk, increasing absence, reducing productivity and may result in fines which will negatively impact the profits and therefore the shareholders.   In 2018, a study by McKinsey found that the top quartile of companies which promoted ethnic and cultural diversity within their executive teams were 33% more likely to lead profitable companies.  Shareholders expect return on investment and companies are looking at ways they can support the communities through offering training to young people who might not have the best education and although there are costs to the shareholders of this, in the longer term the trainees become more productive and profits increase.\nSuccessful CSR\nLego if an example of great practices when it comes to CSR and sustainability.  Lego is renowned for being one of the most reputable companies in the world and not just through helping children develop through creative play but through fostering a healthier planet.  The World Wildlife Fund Climate Savers Partners named Lego in terms of its pledge to reduce its carbon footprint.  The only toy company to be named. \nBy 2030 Lego plans to use only environmentally friendly materials to produce its core products and packaging and one way that is has done this was through shrinking the box sizes by 14% in 2013 and 2014, saving approximately 7000 tons of cardboard.  They moved away from producing the blocks using petroleum-based plastic and has committed to remove all single use plastic packing from its materials by 2025. \nIn addition it has invested $164 million into a sustainable materials centre where researchers are experimenting with different bio-based materials which Lego can implement into the production process.  This is a really good example of how businesses can be socially responsible but also result in increased the profits which almost doubled between 2012 and 2015 and have increased by mover 5 million dollars between 2016 and 2021.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.4 The End of CSR?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.4 The End of CSR?\n\nIn 2012 Peter Fleming wrote about the ‘end of corporate social responsibility’ and he argued that most CSR-related activity was motivated by profit, not principles and CSR was an ideological practice that extended exploitative and colonising agenda of the corporation.\nThe article identified that damage inflicted by global firms is systematic rather than piecemeal.  They also identified gigatrends which are likely to affect the future of humanity such climate change, energy depletion, rise of BRIC nations, the genome revolution and over-population of megactivities located in the southern hemisphere. \nFleming and Jones have argued that actually large corporations tend to act only in the interests of a small number of stakeholders (e.g., their senior managers and equity holders) and therefore lack the ability to deliver outcomes that are beneficial to society as a whole.    Therefore, it could be argued that actually CSR is not about reducing the business effects on society but more a public relations strategy designed to convince governments and employees that they can still do good and make money at the same time.  Brennan argued that CSR is a “parasite” (Brennan, on wider social movements and was really more about the response to damage caused by global corporations.  Large corporates in the past have exploited workers in developing countries and are now exploiting the situation they have caused to the economic advantage to their most powerful stakeholders.  \nCompanies such as Allbirds or Sweetgreen are companies that are building social responsibility as a cornerstone to their business rather than companies that are trying to effectuate the change.  The public today is holding business leaders to account and trust in government is in decline across the UK and USA in particular.  Millennials and Gen-Z are driving this change and exert influences on organisations through purchasing power. \nIs CSR just propaganda designed to cover up parasitic corporate behaviour?\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.5 Activity 1 – Sustainability and Responsible Business

future generations. Sustainability is about using resources wisely so that we don’t harm the planet and can continue to live well in the future.\nMain Global and Business Issues:\nClimate change – causing floods, droughts, and extreme weather that affect farming, homes, and businesses.\nPollution – from factories, cars, and plastic waste, harming air, water, animals, and human health.\nOveruse of natural resources – such as oil, water, and forests, leading to shortages and high costs.\nInequality – some businesses pay low wages or use child labor, which creates poverty.\nWaste management – businesses producing too much waste that ends up in landfills or oceans.\nHow These Issues Started Over Time:\nIn the past, businesses focused only on profit and growth, with little care for th\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762296-20564-topic_9_.docx ---\n9.1 Social enterprise and entrepreneurs?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.1 Social enterprise & entrepreneurs?\n\nA social enterprise is an independent business which is autonomous of the state and government control and set up to help the severely disadvantaged.  For example Jamie Oliver created “fifteen” which is the name of restaurants founded by the Chef to create employment for the severely disadvantaged.\nSocial entrepreneurs are those that work to improve social issues through business whilst generating profit for shareholders.  For example, Bill Drayton is a social entrepreneur and founded Ashoka:  Innovators for the Public in 1980 which looks to find and support social entrepreneurs globally.  He set out to alter existing patterns of activity and vetting and electing social entrepreneurs with unique qualities. \nLatest figures suggest there are over 100K social enterprises in the UK and they have been set up to deal with major problems such as helping overcome child poverty, drop in wages, rising house prices, pollution levels across 40 towns and cities in the UK along with obesity. \nSocial enterprises have flourished due to the failure of existing institutions to solve them through welfare state which was designed to support full, full-time employment or through bureaucracy in terms of slow, costly and dehumanising processes.  Therefore there was a need for a new approach to solving these problems.    Social enterprises get their income mainly from trading in goods and services from fast-moving, evolving environment in comparison to charities that get their income from grants and donations and existing in a more stable and slow moving environment.,    However there are some grey areas in terms of charities as social enterprises.\nThey have characteristics that enable them to transform systems and practices through being innovative, market orientated and driven to system change.  They are good at setting a mission and strong communicators being able to tell the story that focuses on the social good of the product.  They are also visionary and alliance builders and can communicate their aims in moral terms and happy to take help from wherever they can.\nSo where does social enterprise fit it?  Have a look at this image from Clearly So, 2015.\n\nFigure 1:  Where does social enterprise fit?\n\nSocial enterprises operate using different types of business model:\nFee for Service Model:\n\nFigure 2:  Fee for Service model\nIn this model the beneficiary pays for the services for a fee eg Fair for You which is a lender offering an alternative to loan sharks.  The income comes from the interest people pay directly in exchange for the service.  Legally, a charity is the sole owner of the lending company, which can gift profits to the charity.\n\nSubsidization Model:\n\nFigure 3:  Subsidization Model\nHere, the beneficiaries get stuff cheaper or free, and consumers pay for the benefits.  For example TOMS – sells shoes. For each pair sold, another is given to someone in need.  Does a lot more too…\nOf course it may be that the trading just pays for a service to be given away, not just identical products.\n\nEmployment (Social Firm Model):\n\nFigure 4:  Employment (Social Firm Model)\nSocial firms aim to employ people from disadvantaged groups.  They trade to consumers, but people in them get work, dignity, self-respect, or training.  Harry Specters’ mission is to ‘offer confidence and hope to young people with autism by providing employment and free training, enabling them to produce great products, such as our award-winning chocolates. In doing so, we aim to be a role model for “great product, great cause” for other businesses, individuals and entrepreneurs.’\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\nv9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\n\nSome of the social enterprise goals are driven by not profit or shareholder value but through setting their own high standards.  Social enterprises have missions to support and serve social or ethical issues and needs through directly being involved in the production of services.  Social enterprises create jobs and operate by setting a standard of ethics to service the society and one of the key differences is that social enterprises are less concerned with paying owners and stakeholders but more concerned with serving their societal mission.\n\nHere are some examples of social enterprise goals:\n‘Getting something from nothing’ through un-/Under-used physical, social, financial capital or through putting them to use satisfying some unmet social need(s); and by delivering outputs more efficiently than public or private sectors.\nForming long-term relationships that develop over time by outlining how it is Not about providing a service to clients nor is it about short-term profit; but it is about Long-term social return and Inclusivity by creating a sense of membership / belonging and recognising unique, distinct / different needs of users.\nInnovation and creativity:  through design / deliver new approaches to pressing problems and combine approaches from public and private sector bodies and experimenting the ‘R&D wing of the welfare system’ by creating a portfolio of solutions to issues.\nBeing ethical in terms of Britain’s top 5 co-operatives pay more tax than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks; Pay fair wages to 2,000,000 employees; and Do the greatest good possible: 28% of Social Enterprises work in poorest communities (only 12% of SMEs)\nBe successful with more social enterprises generated a profit last year than private, Growth rate of ‘responsible’ brands nearly double that of ‘conventional’ brands; Judged as ‘fairer, more diverse, and serve customers to a higher standard’ than public / private.  Demonstrate their social impact to stakeholders which is Difficult, not impossible.\nHowever Social Enterprises have started working with large corporations to drive impact together.  Through COVID-19 and climate change the private sector has been transformed and has provided corporate leaders with the opportunity to focus on their social responsibilities.  An example of this is when COVID-19 hit and a group of 85 foundations, corporations and intermediaries came together to create the World Economic Forum’s COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs.  Through social procurement strategies the group was able to provide mutually beneficial outcomes for corporations and social enterprises.   Large organisations such as Ikea and Unilever were already adopters of souring from social enterprises and with the support of Ikea Social Entrepreneurship has published the first corporate report on social enterprises.   You can read more about this report here:  How Corporations and Social Enterprises do business together to drive impact – Available at: Acumen | Corporate ReadyLinks to an external site.\nOn of the key changes to employment practices, driven by COVID-19 has been the gig-economy.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\n\nYou were introduced to Uber and the Gig Economy in an earlier lesson but here we will develop this further in terms of how it is changing the world of work.  Uberization has been defined as “fragmented work” where workers are offered small individual pieces of work which the worker can choose to accept or not.  Typically this is offered through apps that is used by both consumers and workers as an interface with little or no intermediatory.  This can have advantages for the worker in that it provides flexibility, greater independence, variety of work and pay.  However there are also disadvantages in the fact that they are not paid benefits such as sick pay, maternity leave or career progression and sometimes find it difficult to switch off. \nFrom a business perspective there are advantages as it lowers costs and gives them flexibility to adapt to scale as workers are not locked into contracts and therefore there is less regulation.  However there are usually high turnover of workers who tend to be less qualified or reliable workers and can lead to poor public perception of the organisation.\nHowever those working in Crowd working can be through global platforms who are looking for highly skilled workers:\n\nFigure 5:  Crowd working and Gig Work\nCrowd employment is a new form of employment that still uses online platform to enable organisations or individuals to solve problems or provide services in exchange for payment eg outsourcing of tasks to pool of online workers rather than single employee.  The work is based on individual tasks rather than continuous work.  Crowd working has been replaced with the term “platform work”.\nThe platform economy has brought benefits in creating jobs but for the individual it usually means they end up working for more than one platform for poor pay resulting in poor working conditions and being unable to financially survive.    Gig work is growing at a rapid rate with the sector more than doubling in size since 2016 with more than 7.25 million workers in the UK in 2022.  Part of this is due to technology and apps to sell their labour but also Covid-19 has had a massive impact in terms of how we work.    Platform economy is eg UberEats or Glovo for example and offers workers per gig basis.  A gig worker sells their skills through a platform and are usually locally based. \nPlatform work is remote and is mainly through providing digital services such as data entry or programming on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr which acts as an auction house for human labour, where individuals bid for work.  Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in lower-wage countries and it has been suggested that the office faces a future like that of the factory floor where work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. \nSadly those that work in the gig economy are no longer protected by a legal system that was designed for a different age as they are defined by workers.  Workers have minimum wage and trade union rights protected as well as paid holiday entitlements.  Only “employees” are entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payment, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal.  Gig-economy firms assume their workers to be self-employed and fight trade union such as the Independent Workers’ Union  of GB who claim otherwise.\nIt is estimated that the number of gig workers is constantly on the increase and the figure employed in this type of work is anticipated to surpass 90 million by 2028.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to keep gig workers as part of their future workforce.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\n\nOne of the other factors influencing the changing world of work is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and how they will impact the creation of new jobs.  The image below shows how these are interrelated:\n\nFigure 6:  AI or Machine Learning (Coinsight.com)\nArtificial intelligence is a computer-based design system to think the way human intelligence does and means more than doing specific tasks like Alexa who responds to your voice.  AI has the ability to make decisions and it learns from data science to create something new.  It has been used to tackle problems such as testing drug compounds for curing cancer.   AI can be used to monitor customer tracking on websites or changing traffic patterns.  Amazon Go uses AI algorithms to create unmanned convenience stores that monitor your shopping experience and charge you automatically when you walk out the door.  For example up to 400 cameras in the store monitor your interactions to charge you appropriately. \nIn contrast machine and deep learning are algorithms which do one task really well eg analysing data over time and therefore are only as good as the data flowing through the system.  Alexa runs machine learning software where the price goes up or down based on your personal information, the email that gets filtered to your inbox or chat boxes that respond when you ask questions.\nCompanies are using deep learning models and AI to stay competitive through using behavioural biometrics or language processes to improve customer service and IT management.  Therefore, data scientists and machine learning engineers are in high demand and managers and organisation need to “manage” these AI processes similarly to how they would manage people as they are a resource.  This can also include “robots” and “robotics” which means development of a new set of skills in the workplace.  AI and machine learning are going to change the way we work but they are not likely to make human workers obsolete for an awfully long time.  Automated tasks are likely to be replaced by AI but it will also drive innovation to create many new sectors for growth resulting in more wider job creation. \nHowever a recent TUC report on AI has identified the ways that AI could lead to discrimination and is calling for urgent legal reform in this area.  One recent example is how Linkedin for example has been pushing “cleaning” adverts to women only.   The case of UberLyft in the Dutch courts held the dismissal by machine as unlawful and how under GDPR automated decision making is prohibited.  The TUC have asked for an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide a right not to be discriminated against or subject to detriment for the processing of inaccurate data or through making all those in the \"value chain” jointly liable for discriminatory AI.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.5 Modern Slavery\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.5 Modern Slavery\n\nDue to the expansion of globalization, one of the outcomes of this has resulted in modern slavery where people are forced to work through threat, or they become owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical abuse, they become dehumanized through being treated as a resource, their freedom is restrained or they are exploited through underpayment (Crane, 2013b).\nRead through the Ethics in Act 7.2 from the text book and reflect on how modern slavery is impacting employees at work.\n\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.6 The Employment Relationship\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.6 The Employment Relationship\n\nEmployees are managed by the HR department and the term Human Resource Management has subject to debate as it implies humans are the resource and usually the most costly resource within an organisation.  Employees have various rights at work such as to respect their employer which is based on a general understanding of human rights and employment law.  The employee also has duties in terms of completing the work based on their contract within wider employment laws.   For example, an employee has the right to freedom from discrimination or to privacy or to health and safety working conditions.  They have duties to comply with their contract, with the law and respect the employers property.   Many organisations have comprehensive diversity, equality and inclusion policies to promote best working practices and engage staff across the organisation.  We have seen earlier sections of this course examples from Marks and Spencer and the MET police in the UK and how they are trying to attract a more diverse workforce.  We have also looked at women in senior posts and gender pay gap reporting and this is still a problem with discrimination practices being demonstrated through the recruitment and selection process and even recent cases such as Asda have highlighted the differences in pay between women and men carrying out like work.\nEmployees are entitled to privacy and control the information about themselves.  \nThere are four types of privacy:\nPhysical – surveillance cameras in private rest areas would compromise physical privacy\nSocial – freedom to behave in our private life as we so choose – however if it brings the organisation into “disrepute” then actions could be taken\nInformational – how, when and to what extent private data about others can be released and breaches eg employees social media can be monitored by organisations if it brings the organisation into disrepute\nPsychological – controlling emotional outburst and not being forced to share private thoughts and feels eg making employees smile and appear happy in front of customers.\nDepending on the organisation and industry, some employers carry out routine health and drug testing of their employees and this has been contested as an issue of business ethics.  The problem is that employees feel that the tests are taken too often and take more information than the employer actually needs and therefore does the test do more harm than good? \nTracking of emails has been common for sometime as well as checking what the employee downloads to their PC and has resulted in dismissals where company information has been leaked or when inappropriate materials have been downloaded.\nSurveillance cameras have become significant in recent years and many offices use these to protect employees and employers and there are many examples of where employees have been caught “red” handed when committing crimes or demonstrating inappropriate behaviours across the workplace.  With Covid-19 and hybrid, home working, the use of surveillance has increased and is currently under debate.  Some of the banks have adopted “key board” tracking surveillance so they can tell when their employees are typing, some are accessing the employees webcam to see when they “move” from their seat and it could be argued this is an infringement of privacy and it is interesting to see how this will develop over the next few years and how employment law/cases will introduce controls in this area.\nHow do you think surveillance will develop in the next five years? \nHow do you feel about this level of surveillance in your home when home working and how would handle this if your employer said this was mandatory from the 1st January next year?\nMake some notes and reflect on these ethical areas of change in the workplace.\n\nTopic

challenging the gig economy can be for drivers and other workers. Many of them work under zero-hour or flexible contracts, which give them freedom but don’t offer proper protections like sick pay, holiday pay, or job security. This creates a situation where workers have high risks but fewer rights.\nFor example, in the UK, Uber drivers have gone on strike several times over low pay, poor working conditions, and lack of rights. One important event was the UK Supreme Court ruling that Uber drivers should be treated as workers, not just self-employed, giving them access to basic rights. Also, the deal between Uber and the GMB union was a big step toward improving representation for drivers, allowing them to raise concerns and negotiate better conditions.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nOffer Minimum Protections: Even if workers are on flexible contracts, employers should give basic benefits like minimum wage, sick leave, and holiday pay.\nClear Contracts: Companies should give workers clear information about their rights, responsibilities, and how their pay is calculated.\nAllow Union Support: Like the Uber-GMB deal, gig workers should have access to unions or worker groups to protect their rights and raise their voices.\nUse Technology Fairly: Companies that use apps to manage workers (like Uber) must ensure the systems are fair, transparent, and not exploitative.\nListen to Workers: Regular feedback and communication with workers can help identify problems and improve working conditions.\nConclusion: The gig economy is growing, but companies must find a balance between flexibility and fairness. Giving workers more rights and protections doesn’t just help them—it also improves company reputation and worker satisfaction in the long run.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:08| Last reply 30 May 8:57\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the articles, it’s clear that Uber’s business model has come under a lot of pressure due to how it treats its drivers. The strikes, pay disputes, and legal challenges show that gig workers often face unstable incomes and limited rights. While Uber has made some progress—like its agreement with the GMB union to give 70,000 drivers minimum wage, holiday pay, and pensions—there’s still more to be done.\nIn the gig economy, many workers are classed as self-employed, which means they miss out on basic protections. To change this, employers should move toward offering more secure contracts that include benefits like sick pay, regular working hours, and protection against unfair dismissal. They should also be more open to working with unions, like GMB, and give workers a voice in decision-making. Fair algorithms and transparent policies on pay and work allocation are also key.\nUltimately, gig work can offer flexibility, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of basic rights.

The gig economy has brought a lot of flexibility to workers, but it also comes with big downsides especially when it comes to job security, pay, and basic rights.\nIn the Bloomberg article, we see concerns over a fuel shortage and a possible union strike, which shows just how fragile the situation can be for gig workers. The Employee Benefits article highlights that drivers are striking over pay, showing that many of them don’t feel fairly treated. But there are also signs of progress. The GMB Union deal article shows that 70,000 Uber drivers in the UK now have union representation, which is a huge step forward. And the Supreme Court ruling confirms that Uber drivers are workers not independent contractors which means they’re entitled to benefits like minimum wage and holiday pay.\nThese developments show that employers can make changes when there’s enough pressure from workers, the public, or legal systems.\nTo improve the situation, companies in the gig economy should:\n•Offer clearer contracts that reflect the reality of the work and provide fair terms.\n•Guarantee a minimum wage, so workers know they’ll earn enough to live on.\n•Provide benefits like sick pay, holiday pay, and pension contributions.\n•Allow union representation so workers have a voice.\n•Be transparent about how pay is calculated and how decisions are made (like deactivations).\nUltimately, flexibility shouldn’t come at the cost of fairness. Gig economy companies can still be profitable while treating their workers with dignity and respect.\nExpand discussion thread from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al AhbabiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nHatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n23 May 17:36| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nReply from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nThe case of Uber in the UK highlights the growing debate around how companies in the gig economy treat their workers. While platforms like Uber have created jobs for many, they have also raised concerns about job security, pay fairness, and workers’ rights.\nFrom the articles, one of the biggest turning points was the UK Supreme Court’s decision in 2021 that Uber drivers should be classified as “workers” rather than independent contractors (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This gave them legal rights to minimum wage and holiday pay, which was a big win for gig workers in the UK.\nLater, Uber made a historic agreement with GMB Union, giving about 70,000 drivers in the UK the right to union representation (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). While this was praised by many, the situation remains tense. Uber drivers have continued to strike, arguing that pay levels are still too low and conditions are not fully fair (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.).\nThese events show that legal victories alone are not enough — real change needs to happen in the way gig workers are treated daily.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve Gig Work Conditions:\nRedefine What “Gig Work” Means: Employers should stop hiding behind the label of “self-employed” just to avoid giving benefits. If the company controls working hours, pricing, and performance like Uber does then the worker should have rights just like an employee.\nCreate Fair Pay Standards: Gig companies should provide a clear minimum pay guarantee per hour, including waiting time. Drivers often spend time online without rides, which affects their real earnings.\nGive Gig Workers a Voice: Companies should regularly meet with driver representatives and unions to discuss policies and pay. Uber’s deal with GMB was a strong start, but more engagement is needed to fix ongoing disputes.\nBuild Flexibility with Protection: Flexibility is one reason why people join the gig economy  but it should not come at the cost of basic protections. Employers should offer opt-in insurance, sick pay schemes, and support services.\nInvest in Worker Wellbeing: Companies like Uber depend on their drivers, but often offer little support during crises like fuel shortages or pandemics. Offering fuel discounts, mental health resources, and fair cancellation policies can build trust and reduce worker stress.\nConclusion\nThe Uber case shows that responsibility and flexibility can go together. While the company has taken some steps to support its drivers, the ongoing strikes and dissatisfaction suggest that more honest, fair, and balanced systems are needed. The gig economy will only be sustainable if workers are treated as essential partners not disposable service providers.\nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n23 May 17:34| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nAfter reading the articles about Uber and its drivers in the UK, it’s clear that the gig economy has created a lot of flexibility — but also many challenges for workers. Drivers often work long hours without stable income, benefits, or job security. The Uber case is a great example of how limited protection through self-employment contracts has raised serious concerns.\nIn the past, Uber classified its drivers as independent contractors. This meant they had no access to minimum wage, holiday pay, sick leave, or pensions. The situation reached a turning point when the UK Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that Uber drivers should be treated as \"workers\", not just self-employed freelancers (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This decision was historic because it forced Uber to rethink its contracts and give drivers more legal protection.\nSince then, Uber signed a union agreement with GMB, giving 70,000 UK drivers access to representation, which was a big step forward (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). Still, challenges remain. According to recent reports, drivers have gone on strike over pay and working conditions, especially during the UK fuel crisis (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.). Many feel the changes haven’t gone far enough.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nFair Contracts: Employers like Uber should move away from using zero-hour or purely self-employed contracts for core roles. If workers rely on the job for regular income, they should receive protections like minimum wage and sick leave.\nWorker Representation: Giving gig workers access to independent unions and allowing them to raise issues safely is essential. Uber’s agreement with GMB is a positive example, but more companies need to follow this model.\nTransparent Pay and Conditions: Companies should clearly explain how drivers or gig workers are paid, including how rates are set and what deductions apply. Hidden fees and unclear commissions create stress and reduce trust.\nSupport for Health and Wellbeing: Gig workers often work long hours with few breaks. Employers can offer support like insurance, access to counselling, or even discounts on fuel and maintenance.\nTechnology Transparency: Many drivers rely on apps to get work, but these systems often control how much they earn or whether they stay on the platform. Workers should have more input into how these systems work and appeal unfair deactivations.\nConclusion:\nThe Uber case shows that change is possible when workers stand up and the law supports them. But more still needs to be done to make the gig economy fair and sustainable. Employers need to take responsibility — not just for profits, but for the people who power their platforms.\nReferences\nADCU. (2021). Supreme Court Landmark Victory Over Uber.

The clashes Uber has faced in the UK highlight the rising disagreements between new technology and workers’ legal rights. By calling Uber drivers employees, the 2021 decision by the UK Supreme Court redefined what employers must and should provide (Supreme Court, 2021). Employers have many solutions they can implement. Formulating rules that protect the hours worked, benefits received and end of employment can give workers a foundation of dignity in the workplace (ILO, 2021). Let’s also ensure that both workers and management work together for solutions. Whilst that agreement shows progress, Uber should now let drivers contribute to pay discussions and work environment (GMB, 2022). Also, websites must work on becoming more transparent. It is important that everyone can review the algorithms that distribute jobs and salaries, to prevent being exploited. In addition, governments and businesses should together establish rules that list platform workers in different categories with suitable perks. The most ethical approach is for people to have the flexibility they want while still earning fair wages. Following this, companies should rewrite their contracts, help workers unify and put people’s wellbeing first.\nReferences\nGMB. (2022). Uber and GMB Strike Historic Deal.

Pandemic > 10.2 Ethical procurement or corporate gravy train?\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying and the giving of contracts during COVID-19 in an early lesson, however during the pandemic the UK government spent £56m on private consultants during the pandemic, at rates of up to £14,000 per day, without giving other companies a chance to compete. \nSixteen private consultancy firms, including major companies like Deloitte, PWC, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey have been working at the heart of the government’s response to the virus and it is suggested that they have made deals with Tory party donors/members worth up to £526 m: P14 Medical; Meller Designs; Globus (Shetland)  They have been rapidly hired to work on the track and trace system, the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the search to produce working ventilators.\nAmong the contracts given to McKinsey, whose consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks’ work – £14,000 a day - to createLinks to an external site. a permanent replacement for Public Health England, helping define its “vision, purpose and narrative”.\nThere is discussion of a close relationship which centred around horse racing between Dido Harding and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, where P14 medical had ten employees and is owned by a Tory Councillor.  Meller’s owner gave £60k to party, Shetland has given £400k for special access to PM etc. as part of the ‘Leader’s Group’. \nAlso, the National Audit Office has carried out a review in terms of regarding the contracting of PPE during the crisis, which was apparently agreed without going through the official process. \nDuring the pandemic, AHRC-funded research has studied questions relating to legal and ethical perspectives and responsiveness within health and social care in the government.  These studies have related to COVID--19 related fraud, public sector procurement and use of management of data by the public sector such as through vaccine development, uptake and delivery.   The University of Bristol have completed a specific study focusing on fraud during the pandemic and whether the rules for criminalizing fraud is fit for purpose.  The research highlighted the need for reform of current practices and that prosecutorial guidance needed to be produced to minimize the role of conspiracy to defraud.  Overall, there needs to be greater transparency in terms of data relating to conspiracy to defraud with suggestions that publication of disaggregated charging figures be used. \nThere are a lot of lessons to be learned from the pandemic in terms of tightening up the governance in organisations to improve processes and business continuity plans through supply chains and sourcing strategies which are redesigned to focus on resilience rather than focusing on lowest price. \nIs this just an amplification of the existing cosy relationship between governments of whatever party, and corporates?\n\nTopic

street is in decline due to the increase in online shopping resulting in a loss of jobs and has created more precarious work for gig economy workers.  Also private landlords have continued to benefit due to contracts to ensure no evictions resulting in a gap between wealthier professionals and those who have to work face to face.    Following COVID-19 and the removal of all restrictions some employers are forcing their workers back to the office which is resulting in the great resignation which reflects how employees are reviewing their work life balance and looking for employees that can offer fully home working or hybrid working.  This is a good article to read which relates to CSR and COVID-19:  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joms.12642Links to an external site..\nFollowing COVID, it has been identified that organisations need to be able to react more rapidly and be more agile and responsive to the needs of policy makers and citizens.   One of the most urgent needs is to build a persuasive knowledge society which is informed by integrated and trustworthy science to develop the knowledge to respond to today’s challenges.  However access to knowledge creation and dissemination needs to be equitable to leading to the three pillars of sustainable development reviewed in an earlier week.  The world we live in needs to be more interconnected and there needs to be solutions designed through open and inclusive sciences through the support of all governments.  International collaboration, engaging with knowledge partners and fostering networks of mutual learning can help problem solve across the world.\nThere is suggestion of a need for more public and private partnerships to engage in the sustainability agenda to enable this rapid response and throughout COVID-19 the private sector contributed most to research activities and were able to share data or make their technology platforms available for track and trace for example.\nOne of the key trends following COVID-19 is how organisations adapt to the new world through for example home/hybrid working.  Some organisations have closed their large offices in large cities in the UK and have moved to fully remove working or a hybrid model with hot desking and employees coming into smaller shared spaces at least once a week.  Flexible working and home working has intensified throughout the pandemic, and it now remains should be return to onsite work?  With organisations that have 100% productivity what is the need to go back to their offices and how will this make it better?  Some employees have refused to return to the workplace, and this is something organisations need to consider.  Organisations need to consider a portfolio-based approach to work in terms of using multiple options such as automation, gig talent, alliances and through outsourcing activities.  Organisations will need to restructure, and they will need to ensure that their employees have the right skills to defuse risk, optimise costs and develop needed capabilities.  Companies that will thrive post COVID will be those that have the right mix of flexibility and resilience.\nMatt Symonds, one of the Co-founders of Fortuna Admissions has suggested there are seven ways to make business truly sustainable post COVID.\nSeven Ways to Make Business Truly Sustainable Post-COVID (forbes.com)Links to an external site.\nThese are:\nFlattening the curve – in terms of for example, demand for health care systems or through the demand for utilities through managing interrelated systems and AI to help individuals respond to market conditions\nEngage with the local community at a grass roots level – going beyond emissions for example and really working with diverse communities through organisations seeing local community as their partners in achieving human security, sustainability and resilience.\nRealise the global impact of your actions – rethink production, trade and consumption models in sufficiency instead of continued growth\nEmpower employees to make them happier and more productive – changes to management thinking and trust to make people happy and productive through remove working by empowering employees. Organisations need to develop trusting relationships characterised by supportive leadership, mutual support and shared commitment.\nDon’t “go it alone” to solve difficult problems – the pandemic has shown that organisations need to pool together their resources to find ways to tackle major challenges and therefore collaboration bring together inter-disciplinary experts who have insight to identify solutions. Having inclusive and productive culture which is underpinned by revised reward systems and promotion partners leads to embedded partnerships.\nDon’t make profit your sole priority – organisations should act responsibly by paying their taxes as opposed to trying to avoid these (as seen in earlier lessons. Organisations that have a “just in time” operational practices and associate this with their financial strategies links to the profit maximizing thing to do. \nEmbrace “green capitalism” – should we revisit the model of capitalism as COVID has shown how shareholder capitalism in the form of cooperative with stakeholders and shareholders is good business.\nHow effective do you think these practices will be post COVID and are there any other practices that you think organisations should consider in the future?\nPost COVID Supply Chain Sustainability Trends\nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis we have seen vulnerabilities to the supply chain and therefore transformational change needs to take place so that in future supply chains are not as significantly affected and trade can still happen.\nOne of the ways this can happen is through increased supply chain transparency.  Due to lockdowns and reduced working, global supply chains were damaged throughout COVID-19 and organisations need to review the resilience of these in future to increase business sustainability.  One of the ways this can happen is through increased technology and digital maps (or digital twins) of their supply chains.  Digital maps contain all the relevant information on an organisation’s suppliers, their sites, any products at risk and enables them to conduct scenario analysis to inform contingency plans.   These maps will help organisations make vital decisions without having to scramble for unorganised data or rely on one or two suppliers during times of change. \nThe Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures provides recommendations on how organisations can assess their own risks and present opportunities for improvements through climate change through innovation of new products and services to create wider range of procurement channels that mitigate risk and drive supplier competition.\nOne of the key trends following COVID is the importance of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in terms of people from vulnerable communities and how they are being exploited through environmental practices.  Organisations need to review their supply chains to make sure they are inclusive and sustainable to move society forwards.\nOrganisations need to consider the reduction with suppliers they have direct as well as indirect contact with.  Most organisations deal with suppliers who then deal with other suppliers in the chain.  The organisation may use the supplier for their ethical and sustainable practices, but how does it view the practices of those two or three layers into the supply chain that they have no direct contact with?  This is interesting and something organisations need to consider in the future.  They may have no contractual relationship with these lower suppliers, but their ethical practices may impact and influence their ethical and sustainability polices. \nOrganisations need to revisit the social agenda and the disadvantaged and marginalised across the communities and what they need to do to drive diversity, inclusion and fairer human rights through meeting the needs of various stakeholders.  Technology is advancing at such a range that it is increasing the privacy and human rights agenda as we have seen in previous weeks of this unit.  There is growing importance for organisation to align new technologies with human right principles.  Organisations need to consider their “executive compensation” packages for retiring or removal of executives.  The community are conscious of these unfair practices and it is clear that large payoffs for corrupt senior executives is no longer ethical or good sustainable business practice.\nHealth and wellbeing are growing areas for organisations through the pandemic but also for organisations to focus more on the long-term physical goals of their employees.  Organisations are investing in programmes such as meditation, yoga and relaxation classes or supporting employees through paid gym membership fees as they have identified that investing in the long-term health of their employees provides benefits to the organisation through better customer services and employee engagement and productivity.\n\nTopic 10\nPrevious\nNext\n10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 10 – Business Ethics in the Pandemic > 10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\n\nDiscussion Activity -

Environment/Sustainability\nPositive Effects: During lockdowns, air and water pollution levels dropped due to reduced travel and industrial activity. For example, cities experienced clearer skies and cleaner rivers.\nNegative Effects: These improvements were temporary. As activities resumed, pollution levels rebounded. Additionally, the pandemic led to a surge in medical waste, like disposable masks and gloves, which increased environmental pollution.\nConclusion: The pandemic showed that environmental improvements are possible but require sustained efforts beyond temporary shutdowns.\n2. Globalisation\nDisruptions: COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages of goods and highlighting the risks of over-reliance on international trade.\nShifts: Some countries began focusing more on local production and reducing dependence on global suppliers.\nConclusion: While globalisation faced challenges, it adapted rather than reversed. The pandemic emphasized the need for more resilient and diversified supply chains.\n3. Stakeholders\nCommunication Changes: With restrictions on gatherings, businesses and organizations shifted to online platforms to engage with stakeholders.\nChallenges: Virtual interactions couldn't fully replace the benefits of in-person meetings, leading to difficulties in building trust and collaboration.\nConclusion: The pandemic accelerated digital engagement but also highlighted the importance of personal connections in stakeholder relationships.\n4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nIncreased Focus: Companies placed greater emphasis on CSR, supporting communities through donations, adapting operations to produce essential goods, and ensuring employee well-being.\nStrategic Integration: CSR became more integrated into core business strategies, reflecting a shift towards long-term sustainability and social responsibility.\nConclusion: The pandemic reinforced the importance of CSR, showing that ethical practices can align with business success.\n5. Third Sector (Charities and Nonprofits)\nAdaptation: Many organizations quickly adapted by moving services online and finding new ways to support communities.\nFinancial Strain: Despite increased demand for services, many faced funding challenges due to economic downturns.\nConclusion: The third sector demonstrated resilience and innovation but requires ongoing support to sustain its vital role in society.\nOverall Reflection: The impacts of COVID-19 confirm many theoretical approaches discussed in the module. They highlight the interconnectedness of global systems, the importance of sustainable practices, and the need for ethical responsibility across all sectors. These insights will be valuable for the upcoming assignment.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:29| Last edited 29 May 6:30| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nEnvironment:\nCOVID caused a short drop in emissions.\nIt showed the need for greener, long-term practices.\nImpact: Boost in eco-friendly tech and digital supply chains.\nExample: DHL used digital mapping to cut emissions and improve delivery efficiency.\nGlobalisation:\nThe pandemic disrupted global supply chains.\nCompanies are now going more local and flexible.\nImpact: Less reliance on overseas suppliers.\nExample: UK supermarkets sourced more local produce due to import delays.\nStakeholders:\nMany workers faced health risks and poor treatment.\nTrust in employers dropped during the crisis.\nImpact: More focus on employee safety and rights.\nExample: Amazon workers protested over unsafe working conditions.\nCSR:\nSome companies helped, others acted selfishly.\nCSR was tested during the pandemic.\nImpact: Increased pressure for genuine, people-first actions.\nExample: Pret offered NHS workers free drinks and discounts.\nThird Sector:\nCharities faced more demand but limited funding.\nShort-term support wasn’t enough.\nImpact: Need for long-term partnerships and stability.\nExample: UK food banks saw usage soar while struggling to meet needs.\nConclusion:\nCOVID revealed ethical and operational weaknesses.\nIt confirmed the need for responsible, fair business.\nImpact: Push for sustainability, fairness, and stakeholder trust.\nExample: Many businesses now include well-being in their long-term goals.\nExpand discussion thread from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf AlmheiriReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAbdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n23 May 12:19| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\nReply from Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n \nEnvironment & Sustainability\nImpact:\nTemporary environmental improvements during lockdowns (e.g. reduced air pollution).\nRise in plastic and medical waste post-pandemic.\nTheory: Confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve – economic shifts affect environmental outcomes.\nExample: Global drop in emissions during 2020, followed by rebound due to recovery activities\n Globalisation\nImpact:\nDisrupted global supply chains led to regionalisation.\nEmphasis on supply chain resilience and local sourcing.\nTheory: Supports “glocalization” – global framework with local execution.\nExample: Firms reshoring manufacturing to reduce dependency\nStakeholders\nImpact:\nShift to digital stakeholder engagement; highlighted the digital divide.\nTheory: Partially challenges Stakeholder Theory – virtual tools aren’t always inclusive.\nExample: Limited access in remote areas affected community involvement\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nImpact:\nCompanies with strong CSR showed higher resilience.\nCSR efforts expanded to include public health and community aid.\nTheory: Supports Business Case for CSR – social responsibility strengthens long-term success.\nExample: CSR-linked firms had better stock performance.\nReference: ScienceDirect (2024)\n\nThird Sector (NGOs/Nonprofits)\nImpact:\nFaced funding cuts, but adapted with innovation and digital solutions.\nTheory: Confirms Resource Dependence Theory – success depends on adaptability.\nExample: Virtual fundraising and partnerships increased\n \nReferences ;\nScienceDirect (2024).

I examined the correlation between each point and theoretical frameworks, as well as whether actual occurrences corroborate or contest such concepts.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nLockdowns resulted in diminished pollutant levels owing to decreased transportation and industrial operations. Conversely, plastic waste has grown due to masks, takeout packaging, and medical supplies. Additionally, several enterprises postponed their sustainability objectives owing to fiscal pressures.\nExample: In 2020, cities like as London had improved air quality during lockdowns, although encountered increased waste from personal protective equipment (PPE).\nTheory: This somewhat undermines sustainability theory, which anticipates long-term advancement. The COVID-19 pandemic shown that advancements might be impeded during crises.\nGlobalisation\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the interconnectedness of the global community. When one nation ceased operations, others were impacted as well. Supply networks were disrupted, trade diminished, and travel ceased. Numerous enterprises began seeking local suppliers to mitigate potential hazards.\nExample: UK supermarkets saw shortages due to the inability of international suppliers to deliver.\nTheory: This validates globalization theory, demonstrating that international commerce amplifies risks during global crises.\nStakeholders\nThe outbreak affected employees, consumers, vendors, and local communities. Some corporations stressed employee wellness, while others focused only on simple survival. Employee welfare and job security surfaced as prominent issues.\nExample: Companies like Morrisons offered monetary incentives to employees, whilst others enacted layoffs.\nTheory: This validates stakeholder theory, which posits that corporations must consider all stakeholders, not alone profit.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nMany companies escalated their initiatives during the crisis. They allocated funds, aided critical personnel, or endorsed the NHS. Some employed their resources to aid the public instead of only selling products.\nExample: McDonald’s provided complimentary lunches to NHS personnel, while BrewDog manufactured hand sanitizers.\nTheory: This substantiates CSR theory, demonstrating that ethical behavior is crucial, particularly during a crisis.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-Profits)\nCharities had considerable difficulties during the COVID-19 epidemic. Events were canceled and contributions decreased. Concurrently, a growing population requires support with nutrition, shelter, and mental health.\nExample: The Trussell Trust, a food bank organization, experienced a significant increase in individuals need food assistance.\nTheory: This undermines the notion that the third sector can consistently bridge the gap; they require additional support and investment during crises.\nFinal Notes for Assignment: COVID-19 confirmed many theories about business responsibility and ethics, but it also showed weaknesses, especially in sustainability and the third sector. These notes will help me explain how theory meets real life in my assignment.\n \n \nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n19 May 13:10| Last reply 23 May 9:26\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Business and Society\nI learned a lot from the courses and my own study. I realized that COVID-19 had a huge influence on many parts of business and society. Here are the effects I've found, along with real-life examples and how they fit with theory.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nThe situation got better in certain aspects at the start of COVID-19. There were fewer automobiles and flights, which meant less pollution in the air. But as time went on, more trash was made, mostly from masks, gloves, and take-out boxes. A lot of businesses also put their aspirations to go green on hold so they could focus on staying alive.\nThis goes against sustainability philosophy since it indicates that when circumstances are tough, environmental ideals aren't always the most important thing.\nGlobalisation\nThe epidemic made it very hard for trade to happen over the world. Because to manufacturing and border closures, a lot of firms couldn't receive the goods they needed. Ford and Toyota, for example, had to cease making cars because they didn't have enough parts. To reduce future danger, several businesses are increasingly choosing local suppliers.\nThis backs up the thesis of globalization by showing how interrelated countries are and how a problem in one location may affect the whole world.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 had an effect on workers, consumers, suppliers, and communities. A lot of people lost their employment or had to work from home. Health and safety were more essential. Some companies did a good job of taking care of their employees (such Tesco awarding bonuses), while others were criticized for not doing enough.\nThis backs up stakeholder theory, which claims that businesses should care for all of their stakeholders, not just their shareholders.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nA lot of businesses started doing more to aid the neighborhood. BrewDog, for instance, provided hand sanitizer, and grocery stores opened early for NHS personnel and seniors. During the crisis, some businesses really cared.\nThis backs up CSR theory by showing that companies can be responsible, even when things are rough.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-profits)\nDuring the epidemic, it was challenging for charities. There were fewer donations and events were canceled. But people wanted their aid more. Food banks like The Trussell Trust, for instance, witnessed a huge rise in the number of individuals who needed help.\nThis goes against some ideas in the third sector since it revealed how hard it is for charities to get by when they don't have enough money.\nConclusion\nThe pandemic showed that business is not just about profit. It confirmed that companies have responsibilities to the environment, people, and society. At the same time, it also showed that in a crisis, some of these responsibilities can be pushed aside. These insights help me better understand how theory applies to real-world situations.\nExpand discussion thread from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n19 May 0:35| Last reply 19 May 8:41\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nAlyazia Ayed Al Ahbabi\nID: 2447614\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Key Areas\n1.

However, these gains were temporary; Less than two years after the pandemic began, emissions had returned to the levels seen before the outbreak, solidifying Blowfield’s (2013) view that many programs for environmental sustainability address surface-level issues without fundamentally transforming systems. The pandemic also paused corporate climate action, exposing a tension between environmental ambition and short-term financial survival. This challenges the optimistic premise in Carroll's Corporate Social Performance model that sustainability is always included in strategic planning. As argued by Blowfield, it confirms the requirement for transformational, as opposed to incremental change.\nGlobalization\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed how vulnerable the world’s supply networks have become, causing major shortages of essential goods. Griffin argued that rising levels of globalization significantly enhance systemic risk, which came to light during the pandemic. Many major companies reassessed the way they source and manufacture goods, prioritizing local and regional production. This question, the ‘globalization at all costs’ perspective emphasized in earlier CSR and stakeholder theories, encourages a risk-sensitive and resilient approach to globalization. Carroll's view that business corporations operate in a tightly linked global stakeholder ecosystem continues to hold, but COVID-19 illustrates that excessive reliance on global interdependence undermines resilience.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 has rewritten stakeholder priorities. Employees' health and well-being were on the radar, highlighting companies' social responsibility beyond profit margins. Amazon was beset by global protests against unsafe working conditions at warehouses, while Microsoft and Salesforce enhanced remote work benefits and mental health support. This confirms the relevance of Stakeholder Theory (Freeman, as cited in Carroll, 2023) that asserts businesses must consider a wide array of stakeholder interests. But it also challenges companies that only gave lip service to stakeholder care before the pandemic. Griffin (2014) states that crises test reputation credibility; in the case of COVID-19, companies that addressed issues honestly with stakeholders kept trust, but others lost their reputations.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nThe pandemic then proved to be a litmus test for genuine CSR. A few organizations shifted gear to purpose-driven action, Unilever handed out complimentary hygiene items, while LVMH converted perfume factories into hand sanitizer production. Such action underlines Carroll's (2023) CSR Pyramid, demonstrating that companies are able to uphold ethical and philanthropic responsibilities even amidst crisis. Yet, other firms reduced CSR spending or applied CSR as publicity, validating Crane's (2016) fear that CSR is symbolic instead of strategic. COVID-19 thus both proved and experimented with theoretical foundations, depending on whether CSR was deeply ingrained or more performative.\nThird Sector\nThe third sector experienced both pressure and visibility. Charity and NGO demand, especially for vaccination outreach, mental health, and food banks, soared. However, funding decreased as governments and donors reallocated resources. This confirms Carroll's and Crane's contention that the third sector is a necessary partner in system-level crises. It also confirms Blowfield's contention that cross-sector working is the solution to sustainable change. However, the pandemic also revealed the weakness of those third-sector organizations that lacked any digital infrastructure or scalable support systems, highlighting a need for capacity-building.\nConclusion\nOverall, COVID-19 strengthened and challenged the strengths and vulnerabilities of current sustainability, CSR, and stakeholder theory. It strengthened such theories as frameworks that are based on ethical leadership, stakeholder interaction, and systemic resilience, but challenged models that were too globalized or superficial. Next-generation business models will be required to evolve accordingly, both theoretically and practically.\n \nSources\nBlowfield, M. (2013). Business and sustainability.

You can read more at:  Responsible Business in a post COVID-19 world | Deloitte SwitzerlandLinks to an external site.\nOne way to do this is through ethical supply chains such as ensuring eradication of child labour, ensuring safe and hygienic working conditions, ensuring employees are paid fairly for the hours worked, ensuring humane and non-discriminatory treatment, demonstrating environmental awareness and removing anti-bribery.\nTesco is an example of an organisation who use multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing.  For example they have an Action, Collaboration and Transformation group that ensures that those that make their garments achieve the living wage through collective bargaining and freedom of association.  They also engage with the Better Cotton Initiative which looks to improve cotton farming practices to bring economic, social and environmental benefits.  Tesco engage in over 30 different initiatives and you can read more about these here:  https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/documents/policies/tesco-and-multi-stakeholder-initiatives-for-responsible-sourcing/Links to an external site.\nConsidering these different factors, who is accountable for responsible business practices?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.2 Responsible Leadership\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.2 Responsible Leadership\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way organisations are lead and in 2020 business leaders had to respond to the crisis at pace with no previous experience to draw on.  They had to balance the safety of their front-line workers with need to enable staff to work from home.  Technology has enabled leaders to be more visible in organisations with some holding weekly company updates which would not have happened pre-COVID.  Also leaders are exposed to some of the social problems such as Black Lives Matter and have to consider how these impact their workforces.  Leaders have had to become more considerate to a wider range of stakeholder needs during the COVID years and have had to make value based and purpose drive decisions during this difficult time.  Leaders have had to create sustained social impact due to mental health and wellbeing responses to the pandemic with some employees refusing to attend the workplace.  They have had to demonstrate caring relationships with customers, employees, families and colleagues along with shareholders and front-line workers. \nAs outlined by CIPD in 2022, responsible leadership has three different levels which became apparent during the pandemic:\nIndividual: the personal integrity of leaders was a critical factor during COVID-19, with leaders under intense pressure. Many talked about needing to fall back onto their personal sense of right and wrong. They spoke of a new-found humility, born out of having to learn to listen to others. \nOrganisational: in terms of role-modelling a response, many felt liberated. People also spoke of ‘taking off their armour’, implying that pre-COVID-19, they were operating in an organisational system that stifled their personal sense of right and wrong. \nSocietal: leaders were heavily engaged with health services and government, trying to ascertain what their organisations could do to help society. Communicating far more with the outside world, albeit virtually, they were in the company of like-minded leaders, sharing a common purpose.  (CIPD, 2022)\nThe pandemic has changed the way we live and work and there is impatience about the pace of change particularly when change was very fast during the pandemic.  Society wants greater justice and fairness through pay rewards and we are seeing various organisations in 2022 starting to strike over pay and conditions.  Organisations are becoming flatter with empathy and accessibility to senior teams which was not seen pre-COVID.  Rana Foroohar reported that if the rich don’t give a bit more today, they may have to give a lot more tomorrow.’ (2022) Financial Times.\nWatch this YouTube video which redefines responsible leadership from Accenture World: 5 Elements of Responsible Leadership | AccentureLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about their comments in terms of responsible leadership?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.3 What now?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.3 What now?\n\nThroughout the lessons you have seen poor practices where COVID loans have been abused by fraudsters and how senior politicians helped their friends with business contacts.  Test and trace used huge amounts of money with the better off being able to avoid financial costs of self-isolation through being able to work at home.  Wage inequality is rising in the UK and fewer are working because of long-COVID and delays to NHS treatment. \nThe ex-conservative government have been accused of “partygate” through not following COVID-19 regulations against individuals who have faced severe suffering through eg loss of loved ones and not being able to attend funerals.  This has resulted in the UK population becoming disillusioned with government and the resignation of Boris Johnson.\nCOVID has changed our lives and people are eager to travel for leisure but hybrid working has had significant impact on public transport and the city economics as people are not travelling to work.   Even though employers are making staff attend the workplace, remote working is here to stay with 25% of all professional jobs in North America being removed by the end of 2022 and this is set to increase.  This home working environment provides many benefits in terms of physical and mental well-being and large companies such as Goldman Sachs have retreated and offering working from home policies.  However we are living through transformation with automation and AI which is changing the skills that organisations are looking for.\n\nDeliotte in their “Workforce of the Future 2030” report have suggested there will be four worlds of work:\nRed – incubator for innovation racing to give consumers what they want, using digital platforms to enable those with winning ideas to be successful, where ideas rule innovation and outpaces regulation with high risks\nBlue – the corporate is king where bigger is better and where organisation size and influence is the best way to protect their profit margins against intense competition and they grow at such a scale and exert influence to become more powerful and larger than national economies\nGreen – corporate social responsibility is business imperative and organisations are characterised by social conscience, sense of environmental responsibility and they focus on diversity, human rights and trust is the basic currency underpinning business and employment\nYellow – humans come first with social-first and community businesses finding the greatest success to prosper. Crowdfunded capital flows towards ethical and blameless brands where organisations have social heart and where humanness is highlight valued.\nWhy not read more from this report

transformation and defining their own ambition level for each of the action fields in their sustainability strategy.  They will need to consider whether they will focus on a certain area or wider range of sustainability measures to remain competitive.   Organisations that fail to make these changes and address sustainability are likely to pose risks to their own business in terms of reputational damage, environmental risks and supply chain risks.  Organisations must make sustainability their guiding principles to boost energy efficiency through increased levels of recycling or rethinking their business model to discover new market potential. \nThe UK government has a 25 year sustainability plan which mainly focuses on environmental effects such as lowering carbon footprint, minimising waste and enhancing biodiversity on their sites.  The government also aims to enhance local communities and business to better contribute to quality of life for future generations.   Some of the work is based in previous mining areas of the UK which have suffered significant disadvantage through the loss of mining as income but also damage to the environment in these areas.  \n (Sustainability plan - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)Links to an external site..\nThe UK government have set targets to ensure better jobs and earning potential across all supply chains, developing prosperous communities across the UK, using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently, minimising ecological damage, considering the impact of climate change and minimising waste.\nCarry

The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.4 Module Summary\n\nThroughout this unit you have been introduced to sustainability and responsible business practices including ethics, corporate social responsibility and changing world of work.  Due to COVID 19 the speed of change across the world has intensified and organisations need to consider and develop these practices to be really sustainable and responsible businesses of the future.  They also need to consider problems the world is facing in relation to climate change, poverty, rising cost of living related to energy costs, online GP appointments and hospital visits and self-driving cars.  Producing foods including meets which are less harmful to the environment will be a key challenge for agriculture and overall a key investment in saving the planet for future generations will be key for business over the next 10-15 years.\nWhat changes do you think needs to happen to make organisations more sustainable and responsible?\n11.5

of right and wrong and we will consider this firstly from a moral, rather than a business perspective.  Ethical theory underpins the study of business ethics, and it is important that you have a grasp of this as you work through this module as you will need to demonstrate your understanding throughout the assessment.   Therefore the theory of ethics attempts to provide a clear, unified account of our own ethical obligations.  There are three main theories of ethics which you will review during this week – utilitarian, deontological and virtue ethics. \nHowever there are also Normative ethical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong from a given situation (Crane and Matten, 2016).  We will look at these in the next section.  They are important to the ways that businesses make decisions that can be defended, justified and explained to relevant stakeholders.  These theories will differ in terms of how you determine the moral worth of an action, and we will explore this during this week.  So where do ethics and theory of ethics come from?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\nv2.2 Where has ethics come from?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.2 Where has ethics come from?\n\nEthics is underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics and we will review each of these in this section.  There is a long history of ethical theory and the decision of right and wrong has been of utmost importance since life began and, in some cases, it is a matter of life and death for people across the world.\n\nFigure 1:  Image showing ethics underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics\nOver time the arenas for these ethical discussions have developed into organised religion, schools of philosophy, and political movements and parties.  The ethical discussions we have today, including those in a business context are, therefore, shaped by our own historical, religious, and cultural backgrounds, which can of course be very different depending on where we’re from.  And these categories have always and still do overlap.\n\nReligion\nRules and principles of religion advise us that there should be no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct or intoxicants through the religious teachings.  Religion and faith are a set of rules of how to act ethically and spiritually and there are consequences for the actions in terms of salvation, enlightenment, reincarnation or damnation. \nTherefore religion teaches us to:\ndemonstrate honesty and fidelity to family and those we know\nbe non-violent, demonstrate self-restraint, non-stealing, purity, truth\nconsider how every breach of promise in commerce is a sin\nlove one’s enemies, turn the other cheek\nhow morality for you and for others, including business behaviour\nLet’s look at religion and the six here are divided into three from the far east and south asia, and three what are called Abrahamic religions.\nBuddhism is concerned with the good life as we live it\nConfucianism the duty is more about people we know closely, more than the general responsibility to all others\nHinduism tenets are more universal, we should be like this with everyone\nJudaism is specific about business – more on this than on food/kosher etc in the holy texts.\nChristianity similar to Judaism but also talks of 7 sins and 7 virtues\nIslam forbids the charging of interest\nInfluence of religion endures today, however there are differences between Catholic/Lutheran and Calvinist traditions in Europe and the USA and there are specific injunctions around abstaining from economic life (holy days) or the practice of charging interest.  Interfaith declaration (1994) set key principles of justice; mutual respect; stewardship; honesty and recently religious figures have been commenting on business practice, investing or divesting wealth in various industries.   An example of this is where the Church of England tried to rescue Wonga (the loans company) and convert it to a non-profit organisation. It was asked to stop investing in Amazon, but hasn’t, despite saying it was a bad company.  The Church of England is an investor not just a faith and they have an investment fund valued at £9.2 billion which has been criticised for where it invests this funding, and this fund has received a return of 8.5% per year.  It plans to divest from fossil fuel companies by 2033, although some leading figures in the Church of England and its investment board have a background in companies like BP and Esso and therefore whether this will happen or not is open to discussion.\nThinking about Christianity and Easter and Christmas and business closure at these times of the year.  How do organisations overcome the differences when some of the employees do not celebrate these events and therefore eg have to have different practices in place for other religions?\nIn the UK there are still examples of traditional Christian practices such as lack of Sunday opening across some businesses and being the day when families attended church. \nWhat other practices can you think of that have a religious focus?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\n\nEthical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong for any given situation, for example:\nNormative ethical theories are those that propose to prescribe the morally correct way of acting\nDescriptive ethical theories seek to describe how ethics decisions are actually made in business\nWhen it comes to the role of ethical theory, there are two extreme positions\nEthical absolutism asserts eternal, universally applicable moral principles:\nRight and wrong are objective qualities, can be rationally determined\nEthical relativism claims morality is context-dependent and subjective:\nNo universal rights & wrongs that can be rationally determined, all depends on person making the decision, culture in which they operate\nThe following image shows a typology of ethical theories and how they are divided into conduct and character and then the different theories such as egoism, utilitarianism, Kantianism, Aristotelianism.\nCan you think of an example of poor ethical conduct at work?\nCan you think of poor ethical characters at work? \n2.4 Unilitariansim\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.4 Unilitariansim\n\nAccording to utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it results in the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people affected by the action, and also names as the “greatest happiness principle” which is based on a similar approach to cost-benefit analysis.  Jeremy Bentham contributed to this theory, and he suggested that “humans are motivated by avoidance of pain and gain of pleasure” resulting in “consequentialist” theory of ethics.  “Consequentialism” means the moral quality of an action is determined by its consequences eg right or wrong will depend on the consequences of an act eg lying is wrong but if it saved it a life then it would be right (moral quality of the action). \n\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724-1804) derived ethics of duty and argued that morality and decisions about right and wrong are not dependent on situation or actions.   He suggested that morality was defined by a set of moral rules that humans should apply to all relevant ethical problems (Crane and Matten, 2016).   He suggested three principles that constitute a “test” of whether a particular action should be ethical.\nPrinciple 1: Consistency - Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\nPrinciple 2: Human Dignity - Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only.\nPrinciple 3: Universality - Act only so that actions are “universally lawgiving” i.e. that rules guiding our actions are acceptable to every rational human being, not because they have been told to accept them i.e. would others agree with you?\n \nConsider the following transplant dilemma:\nA brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveller, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine check-up. In the course of doing the check-up, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor.\nDo you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.6 Virtue Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.6 Virtue Ethics\n\nVirtue ethics uses character and integrity-based approaches to business ethics with the message “good actions come from good persons” (Crane and Matten, 2016).   These contend that morally correct actions are those undertaken by actors with virtuous characters. Therefore, the formation of a virtuous character is the first step towards morally correct behaviour and not just a one-off decision Some of the acquired traits are:\nIntellectual virtues – “wisdom”\nMoral virtues – “honesty”, “courage,” “friendship”, “mercy”, “loyalty”, “modesty”, “patience” etc.\nEthics of virtue are central to the notion of “good life” and Aristotle argued that when we do something we do it to gain an end and that the ultimate end of all ends was the chief good, the greatest good.  Aristotle suggested that the best businessman is the one who practices virtue, not the one who makes the most money and this is because s/he can be satisfied with that goodness.   Therefore, if it’s good for you it will be good for all and thinking it’s good for all will help you be good.\n\nTopic 2\n2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\n\nEthics can be defined by natural rights or alternative frameworks that focus on relationships such as eg feminist ethics.  Natural rights are based on basic, important, unalienable entitlements that should be respected and protected in every single action, such as:\nbased on consensus about nature of human dignity\nstrongly based in western view of morality\nWhereas justice is the simultaneously fair treatment of individuals in a given situation with the result that everybody gets what they deserve such as:\nFair procedures (procedural justice)\nFair outcomes (distributive justice)\nThere are strong in the western tradition and flows from politics.  However should we all receive equal benefit?  Or should we strive for equal access to opportunity?\nThere are some limits of traditional theories in that they are:\nToo abstract\nToo reductionist\nToo objective and elitist\nToo impersonal\nToo rational and codified\nToo imperialist\nDo you think we look to alternative approaches?\n\nPlease use the accordions to reveal more information\nFeminist ethics\nDiscourse ethics\n\n\n\nPluralist approach\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.8 Ethical Decision making\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.8 Ethical Decision making\n\nEthical decision making is the process you would follow to ensure that decisions are based on ethical values.  For example, thinking of COVID-19 and health care professionals, many ethical dilemmas were presented in terms of making life and death decisions whilst allocating scarce resources eg such as the ventilators.  Ethical decision-making focuses on clarifying thinking about the issues, assist in the analysis of the issues involved and providing a rational way to defend a particular course of action.    Decisions have to be made on the best available information and information and personal choices must be respected.  These are generally concerned with decision making and particularly in making models of how this occurs, and ethical theories, principles and values can help but won’t solve the dilemma on their own. \nSo what is an ethical decision?  It is one that:\nIs likely to have significant effects on others\nIs likely to present with a number of choices\nOne or more party perceives this as an ethical question – even if you do not! If you use someone’s Netflix login you probably don’t care. Do they?\nThe diagram below provides a framework for understanding ethical decision making:\nFramework for understanding ethical decision-making\n2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\n\nRights and duties are really important in the workplace and Crane and Matten (2019, pg. 292) have produced a list resulting in a code of contract for ethical employment and it covers some of the “grey areas” which are not always covered by employment laws and regulations.\n \nFigure 4L  Rights and duties of employees (Crane and Matten, 2019, p.292)\nThe rights and duties of employees sets out the relationship between them and it offers the employees benefits in exchange for performance and for adhering to the rules.    Organisations need to provide training and outline the values of business ethics to employees in order to improve ethical decision-making in the workplace.  Senior leaders need to be the role models and demonstrate ethical behaviours and they need to be accountable for ethical violations and ensure they keep their promises and commitments to the workplace.   However organisations need to be careful as ethical decisions could be influenced by reward eg doing the right thing is rewarded for example, financially by managers and these practices need to be embedded within the values and practices demonstrated across the organisation.   Therefore ethical behaviour should be rewarded, and unethical behaviour should be punished.  Stakeholders have power to influence leaders and they should ensure that pressure is placed on stakeholders to act both ethically and unethically.\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\n\nThere is no longer a “job for life” and employees will experience different jobs and even careers across their working lives.   Post-Fordism is the term that is used to demonstrate how industrial production has moved away from huge production factories, pioneered by Henry Ford towards now where we have very much a knowledge economy.  In the Fordist era there were strong trade union representation and employees were given annual rises related to productivity and industrial peace (no strikes).  However we now are facing the rise of the “precariat” worker who has little or no job security (eg Uber drivers), little or no savings and many are often migrants to the UK or from BAME backgrounds.  Jobs such as Uber driving offers some semi-regular pay from very low-skilled work.  Currently young people have massive university debt that they are struggling to repay and graduates with a degree but few employment prospects.  As Uber drivers are classed as “workers” rather than “employees” they were not entitled to some basic rights such as sick leave, holiday pay and the minimum wage, however following a legal battle in 2021, Uber has now agreed to pay these to their drivers.  These drivers are typically contracted under non-standard arrangements eg on zero-hour contracts or independent contracts or through an agency.  These contracts really help employers cut costs and say in business; however it is a huge exploitation of individual employment rights. \n\nSome Business Examples of ethical practices during the Pandemic\nDuring the pandemic Cineworld closed down and staff found out through twitter and news reports rather than directly from management within the organisation.\nSecondly, Boohoo were part of the Levitt enquiry which focussed on duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain.\nThe enquiry found:\nBoohoo’s extraordinary commercial growth has been so fast that its governance processes have failed to keep pace.\nIt has concentrated on revenue generation sometimes at the expense of the other, equally important, obligations which large corporate entities have.\nIt has not felt responsible for conditions in the Leicester factories on anything other than a superficial level; and\nOn occasions it has failed to appreciate that with the enormous advantages of being a publicly listed company come responsibilities, one of which is on all occasions to act in the best interests of all the shareholders\nA conclusion was reached that the true reason that Boohoo did not become more involved in monitoring conditions in Leicester was that it saw it as being a lower priority than matters which directly affected the company (such as commercial issues or their own employees). The Leicester workers were not employed by them and so they were not their responsibility in the way that their own workforce is. To some extent this is understandable, but can lead to serious issues of the kind which Boohoo is now facing\nSports Direct and Amazon are also facing similar criticisms and you should read the case studies about some of their poor practices in the workplace:\nAmazon - Amazon raises wages amid criticism - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nSports Direct - Sports Direct staff 'not treated as humans', says MPs' report - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about these organisations?  Would it entice you to go and work for them?\n\nDiversity and Inclusion at Work\nDiversity and inclusion have become important practices within the workplace and research suggests that a more diverse workforce is good for business such as that:\nIt can lead to more creative problem solving, innovation, and being more responsive to change.\nGives a better knowledge of diverse markets / clients.\nOrganisation has a wider talent pool to draw from.\nIt can be a PR boost from being seen to manage diversity well.\nIt can lead to higher profits -10% increase in women in organisation linked to 3% in increase in profits\nMany organisations still have a white male orientated senior leadership team in the UK and although things have been changing BAME and women are still underrepresented at senior levels in organisations.   Part of this is due to women still being classified as care workers and working part-time to be carers.   The UK introduced the gender pay gap so that organisations with over 250 employees have to publish the differences in averages between men and women, however in 2021 there was still gaps in the amount men and women were paid eg in education women were paid 26% less than men.  Gary Lineker working for the BBC was the second highest paid star at the corporation and paid more than women in similar roles.  Organisations have to address these challenges through fair procedures and although discrimination is wrong, poor practices in the workplace are still being evidenced.  This is an area for conflict as employees want to be paid the fairest and highest pay whilst employers want to pay the lowest to increase their profits and there has to be balance between high pay and high profits. \n \n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nIssues Involved\nRight to freedom from discrimination.\nEqual opportunities.\nAffirmative action.\nReverse discrimination.\nSexual and racial harassment.\nRight to privacy\nHealth and drug testing.\nWork-life balance.\nPresenteeism.\nElectronic privacy and data protection.\nRight to due process\nPromotion.\nFiring.\nDisciplinary proceedings.\nRight to participation and association.\nOrganization of workers in works councils and trade unions.\nParticipation in the company's decisions.\nRight to healthy and safe working conditions.\nWorking conditions.\nOccupational health and safety.\nRight to fair wages.\nPay.\nIndustrial action.\nNew forms of work.\nRight to freedom of conscience and speech.\nWhistleblowing.\nRight to work.\nFair treatment in the interview.\nNon-discriminatory rules for recruitment.\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nIssues Involved\nDuty to comply with labour contract\nAcceptable level of performance.\nWork quality.\nLoyalty to the firm.\nDuty to comply with the law.\nBribery\nDuty to respect the employer's property.\nWorking time.\nUnauthorized use of company resources for private purpose:\nFraud, theft, embezzlement.\n\nSUBSECTIONS TO COVER:\n\nCase Study 1:\n- Requirements: Describe the case and its ethical dimensions.

Or should organisations who make the wealth and set the standards we work to and live by be the ones that dictate this fairness?\nThere are some obvious talking points here, not just in the UK but across the world as authoritarian leaders focus on national interests to change behaviours.  However culture also plays a part as it needs to consider the interactions between different groups across society.  The following examples discuss how culture impacts different groups in everyday existence.\n\nFor example, in 2019 Parkfield primary school, a largely Muslim school suspended lessons about LGBT rights and homophobia following protests from parents.  The lessons had been designed to help children accept differences in society and teach them about religion, gender identify, age and disabilities.  However following criticism from some of the schools’ Muslim parents relating to same sex-couples education in the lessons the school suspended these lessons.  Parents insisted that the classes were not appropriate for their children by keeping them at home from lessons on a Friday.  The school suspended the lessons and the children returned to school.\nA second example is where an older generation of feminists (represented by JK Rowling) were confronted by angry activists for not supporting trans rights.  Rowling took to Twitter following a tweet that read “people who menstruate” instead of what she should thought should be “women who menstruate” and then went to add “If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. . . . I do not believe it’s hateful to say so.” (NY Post, 2020).  This tweet resulted in thousands of replies declaring Rowling a transphobic, bigoted TERF (trans-exclusion radical feminist) and impact of globalisation and different cultures and their values.\nSome of the factors that contribute to these differences are identified through Demographic methods (DEMOG).  Recent political surveys have shown huge generational differences between how older and younger adults view issues from climate change, through to Brexit and immigration and up to how we should respond to the pandemic.  However gender differences are more nuanced such as where the majority of white women voted for Trump to be elected, compared with less among white men.\nEconomic factors can also influence perceptions and views across society.  For example, automation can cost jobs, or improve productivity.  Which way do you think it will go?  The world of work has been changing significantly over the last few years, but Covid has also speeded this up with more hybrid and home working.\nGlobalisation is another factor that has significantly impacted sustainability and responsible business practice as it focuses on the key context for business practice such as through imports, exports and business location.  Globalisation has seen businesses being able to buy, sell and produce goods across the world, sometimes buying materials at a lower cost or producing where labour is most experienced or even cheaper to help with their own bottom line.  Globalisation is a topic that we will review throughout this module and each of the weeks to come.\nThe image below shows the largest container ship, which represents an emblem of the steady growth in international trade since the mid-90s, when the Word Trade Organisation, the global body dealing with the rules of trade, was established.   Up to 2021 the value of global trade had reached a record level of $28.5 trillion which was an increase of 25% on 2020 and 13% higher than 2020 (Unctad, 2021). \n\nFig1:  World Trade Organisation (2020)\nEven more dramatically, since 1950 we have seen a total increase in trade volumes of 4220%.  So what does this mean for you, your organisation and sustainability and responsible business practice?\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment and is as important as making and growing the organisation.  Organisations need to be productive without negatively impacting people, the planet or the environment and one way they  can do this is through ethical behaviour.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\nv1.2 Ethics and the Law\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.2 Ethics and the Law\n\nBusiness ethics is the study of business situations, activities and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed such as through how different organisations treat their customers, their staff, the planet and even their suppliers (Crane and Matten, 2016).  They are interrelated terms that can exist separately although most ethical considerations and are usually legally enforceable.  They describe the ways business should behave. It provides the social, cultural, legal and economic limitations to protect the interests of various stakeholders.  It also emphasis moral and social values such as welfare, consumer protection and fair business practices.   For example, thinking about the introduction of the government policy relating to plastic shopping bags.  This policy was to emphasis sustainability and to protect resources for future generations as well as reducing the use of single-use carrier bags to encourage people to reuse bags.  The scheme has so far worked as there has been a reduction of supplied single-use carrier bags  by over 95% and the money raised has totalled nearly £180m for good causes.\nBusiness needs to operate ethically to be successful and they need to create their own ethical business practices (EBP) which includes a culture where individuals in the business make decisions and act in ways that build sustainable business.  They also need to show a care for all the needs of the stakeholders working within these ethical and legal guidelines. Organisations that demonstrate unethical behaviours are usually named and shamed on social media sites and research has shown that up to 50% of customers are concerned with unethical businesses practices and are therefore prepared to move their business to more ethically proven business.  \n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.3 Globalisation\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.3 Globalisation\n\nAccording to Scholte (2005) globalization is not:\n‘internationalization’\n‘liberalization’\n‘universalization’\n‘westernization’\nGlobalization is a process which diminishes the necessity of a common and shared territorial basis for social, economic, and political activities, processes, and relations  and can result in deterritorialization (where a territory has its organisation destroyed through growth of cultural flows).   As we have seen earlier, globalisation has intensified since 1989 and this has  been caused by the collapse of the Eastern Block (former communist states in East and Central Europe eg Soviet Union, Albania, Yugoslavia for example) in 1989 when the cold war came to an end and the Berlin Wall came down.  This resulted in wider range of countries opening their borders and allowing people to escape to the West.   China has also contributed to global wealth during this time through foreign investment resulting in it boosting its exports of technology and capital which has allowed it to grow to be the second largest economy after the US. \nThere are many organisations that have benefitted from globalisation, and I imagine you can name a few.  However, one of the organisations that has benefitted from this is Nike who has manufacturing plants in almost every country of the world except Russia, most of African and some of the Middle East.  Nike’s set up factories across the world and now employ over 1.02 million workers in 42 countries to produce all its products.  29% of its products are made in China and 44% in Vietnam.  Only 76,000 of employees are actually employed by Nike.  However through globalisation Nike has been able to extend is sale of products and services from US to all over the world developing its brand and economic success. \n\n\nEconomically, there are gains, but how are these gains distributed across the different countries of the world?\nInterestingly, Switzerland, Ireland and Holland are in the top 3 countries across the world that have benefitted in terms of growth of income with Ireland being one of the most globalised economies.  The globalisation index by the Bertelsmann Foundation measures economic, political and social aspects of worldwide network economies and ranks countries overall.  Ireland has increased its globalisation rating due to its favourable climate, its central location between North America and Asia and its tourism appeal.  Ireland has also attracted foreign investment through these positive characteristics but also through having the population who are fluent in English.  The republic of Ireland has been a full member of the EEU and therefore been able to position itself well, particularly in relation to Brexit.  It also has low population density which means that there is room for growth.\nGlobalisation has allowed for free trade; it has lowered or abolished tariffs which has  increased the movement of labour and goods across several countries.  This has allowed organisations to focus on an area in which it represents competitive advantage such as through lack of regulation of global financial or cheaper labour.  Shareholders have sometimes looked at profit over ethical working practices, and example of this is Primark. In 2009, Primark were found to be employing illegal workers and paying their staff less than the minimum wage by using child labourers to produce their garments in refugee camps in Southern India.  The working conditions were very poor, but this child labour enabled Primark to grow through cheap production costs in a country outside of the UK.  This negatively impacted their brand and Primark has worked hard to rectify these poor practices over the last few years by signing up to an Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI’s) base code of labour practices based aligned to the International Labour Organisation standards.  This is an example of where Primark was able to outsource production to developing countries in order to reduce their costs in the global marketplace.  This has been positive as it provides jobs in these developing countries, but it also raises the potential for exploitation of employees through poor working conditions.  More than this, jobs in industrialized regions of developed countries have been put at risk, something which Donald Trump talked about very effectively in the 2016 US election. \nGlobalization can bring cheaper prices to consumers, but vulnerable consumers in developing countries may also face the possibility of exploitation by Multinational Corporations (MNCs).  These products can provide social benefits to consumers; however this can also be met with protests about cultural imperialism and westernization in less wealthy countries.   Global business activity brings the company in direct interaction with local communities and has the possibility of raising the erosion of traditional community life.\n\nGlobally active pressure groups emerge with aim to “police” corporations in counties where governments are weak and corrupt.  One example of global pressure groups is Greenpeace.  It was formed in 1971 to protect natural resources.  They are currently working with others to protect our natural world due to rising sea levels, extreme weather as the climate breaks down through destructive industries which pollutes forests, oceans and the air.  In 2020, they protested against Shall Oil and their plan to pollute the North Sea by abandoning an estimated 11,000 tonnes of oil on the sea.  The protestors on the Greenpeace Ship, Esperanza approached a 500m exclusion zone of Shell’s platform waving banners and calling on Shell to clean up its mess. \n\nFigure 2:  Greenpeace at Brent Oil Rigs (The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site.)\nShell wanted to dismantle these platforms in the sea as cheaply as possible, putting profit before people, however Greenpeace insisted that these platforms must be removed in an environmentally friendly manner.   You can read more about the Brent Story and Shell’s sustainability here - The Brent Story | Shell United KingdomLinks to an external site..  As at March 2022 a decision is on the way but as, yet this has not been published.\nGlobalization weakens governments and increases corporate responsibility, for example, jobs, welfare, maintenance of ethical standards through increased budgetary pressures. Globalization confronts governments with corporations from regions with different cultural expectations about issues such as bribery, corruption, taxation, and philanthropy and decisions have to be made how to co-operate in an ethical and legal way, for example when organisations try to bribe the local government officials to accept their plan for redevelopment of premises, for example which is not in the best interests of the local community.\n\nHowever, globalization is good for all of us as it provides us with a much wider range of products and services and access to experiences we would not have in our own country.  However, turning our backs on globalization would take us down the wrong path.   It is the emerging and developing countries which have achieved only below average levels in the globalization index thus far and therefore still have great potential to globalize. By doing so, they could generate correspondingly high globalization-induced growth effects. This is why it is essential that emerging countries become better integrated into the global economy. In industrialized countries, it is necessary to spread the benefits of globalization more widely so that social acceptance of an open society is not lost.” Overall, if globalization (measured by various indicators) increases by 1%, there is a .33% increase in GDP.    You can read more about the global index here:  https://kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2021/12/kof-globalisation-index-2021.html#:~:text=The%20KOF%20Globalisation%20Index%20measures,the%20period%201970%20to%202019Links to an external site..\nThere is, however, considerable variation in impact on inequality in the developed world.  Broadly, in the US and UK, inequality has risen with globalization. In continental Europe and Japan, it hasn’t.  For example,  Equal Opportunities legislation has tried to target and ensure procedural justice is promoted through best practices and prosecuting those that do not comply.  In addition, pressure groups have grown in recent years attempting to address the social imbalances such as the Black Lives Matter movement who were founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer.  Their mission has been to eradicate white supremacy and build local power or to intervene in violence which is inflicted on Black communities.  This group has gained momentum through the murder of George Floyd and the group is being supported by celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton.   This is an example of a group that tries to advance the rights of under-represented individuals. However, there are many more.\nOrganisations have to comply with equal opportunities legislation such as the Equality Act 2010 in the UK and ensure for example during the recruitment practices, policies are fair and do not discriminate applications based on eg sex, race, age, religion etc.  Job descriptions need to be produced which provide fair criteria which applicants can be assessed against and use wording that does not discriminate applications, for example “only white males need to apply”.\nOnce individuals have been employed in an organisation then training programmes need to be open and fair to all of them, for example running programmes at a time of day that part-time staff can attend.  Organisations must ensure that they do not prioritise certain staff over others in terms of promotion to senior positions, particularly those from discriminated groups. \nOrganisations have moved to more diversity workforces and organisations like M&S and Metropolitan police have used targeted campaigns in London to try and address racial inequality through promoting equal opportunity for all, although they have had to be careful to ensure recruitment is still fair to all.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.4 So, what is Sustainability?\n\nSustainability is a key driver in the business environment, and it seeks to promote best practices to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources when developing products and services.   In 2022 we have seen souring temperatures across the UK and wildfires caused through climate change.  Organisations need to develop products and services without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs such as eg combating the o-zone layer (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)\nSustainability refers to the long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic and social considerations. \nOne of the ways to do this is through the triple bottom line:\n\nFigure 3:  Triple Bottom Line\nThe Triple bottom line model discussed by John Elkington in 1984 moved away from businesses focussing solely on financial performance but looked at people, planet and profitability which provided organisations with insight into the connections between environmental health, social wellbeing and the organisations financial success.\nThe traditional bottom line – profit – is supplemented by novel ways of accounting for an organisation's performance with respect to:\nPeople. How does the organisation stand in its treatment of employees, customers and the wider community? Is it doing all it can to maximise its performance in these areas?\nPlanet. How well is the organisation doing in its treatment of the natural environment? Is it using more resources than it needs to? Is it damaging the environment, through pollution or through making products, with poor environmental performance?\nAs we might expect from a model based on accounting, the triple bottom line model is particularly useful in providing checklists of areas of sustainability performance which an organisation should examine carefully.\nThe triple bottom line model can usefully be applied to all profit-making organisations and can also prove useful for non-profit organisations as well. For example, the diagram above has a close fit, in many areas, to the activities of an organisation like Anglia Ruskin University, since we have to pay attention to nearly all of the items listed in the diagram above – apart from total shareholder return.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.5 Covid-19\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 – Introduction to Sustainability and Responsible Business > 1.5 Covid-19\n\nSo what about the pandemic? What implications are there for business ethics?  Through the government measures to stem the spread of coronavirus some companies have positively put their employees before their profits ensuring both staff and customer safety as an overwhelming priority.  They have also cut executive pay rather than avoiding rising costs to customers. \nHowever, the government has bailed out companies on the brink of bankruptcy and has propped up wages of workers through furlough scheme which impacts organisations and society and does bring a question in terms of the balance of fairness. Organisations such as Netflix stated they would stop charging inactive customers and Unilever pledged to stop targeting children with adverts. Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on jobs, profits, trade and movement and even 4 years later travel is still a long way from where it used to be, however it has brought some positives in terms of hybrid working for employees, but this has also been at a cost to the high street.\n\nTopic 1\nPrevious\nNext\n1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 1 –Introduction to Sustainability & Responsible Business > 1.6 Reasons why business ethics is important\n\nHere are 8 reasons why business ethics is a vital subject.  \nThese are:\nIt has power and influence of business in society\nPotential to provide major contribution to society\nPotential to inflict harm\nIncreasing demands from stakeholders\nLack of business ethics education or training\nContinued occurrence of ethical infractions\nEvaluating different ways of managing business ethics\nInteresting and rewarding\nCan you add any others?\nTherefore, throughout this first study week you have been introduced to some of the key concepts of sustainability and responsible business and the importance of ethical business practices.\n\nTopic 1\n\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nBusiness and Society is associated with the tension between ethical behaviour and wealth creation, for example the table below shows some examples of the issues, similar to the PESTEL headings:\nSocial\nPolitical\nCultural\nDemographic\nEconomic\nEquality\nDivisions\nPrejudice\nGenerational\nInequality\nFairness\nInstitutions\nXenophobia\nGender\nCSR\nMobility\nDemocracy\nRacism\nMigration\nBad practice\nVulnerability\nAccountability\nReligion\nWar\nTechnology\n \nTrade\nTraditions\nFamine\nGrowth\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761a8e-20564-Topic_3.docx ---\n3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Crisis > 3.1 Origins of Sustainable Development\n\nThe United Nations was founded in 1945 with 51 original Member States and this international organisation is comprised of 193 Member States today.  The UN defines sustainability as the development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations.  The UN set up a commission to review the problems of economic development where global resources are limited.  Economists argued that economies could not grow as natural resources were finite and were becoming more difficult to obtain.  Therefore, if economic activity was to be 'sustainable' into the far future, more attention would have to be paid to rate at which resources were consumed.

Some suggestions:\nGood health and well-being - all organisations who care about their employees, health-related organisations such as the pharmaceutical industry.\nSustainable cities and communities - the construction industry, local government.\nLife on land - agriculture and agribusiness, any potentially polluting industry.\nEducation - Anglia Ruskin University is concerned with this one, as are all of your organisations in supporting your study here.\nWhen you examine the goals more deeply you will see that they interconnect, and that almost any organisation needs to pay attention to a large number of them.\nA goal without well-considered plans and actions underpinning it is worth very little, and the SDGs are supported by a knowledge base Links to an external site.and an unfolding set (a very large one) of initiatives.\nWe could spend the entire module looking at the UN SDGs, but unfortunately, we do not have enough time for that.

The 8 goals were realistic and easy to communicate, with a clear measurement and monitoring mechanism.   However, in 2012 UN developed a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)s to fit the global development framework beyond 2015.  This created a new people-centred, development agenda and engaged citizens, scientists, academics and private sector in the process and created 17 new goals:\n\nFigure 2:  UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2015)\n\n3.4 Climate Change\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 3 – Sustainable Development Goals & the Climate Crisis > 3.4 Climate Change\n\nClimate change is already impacting public health, food and water security, migration, peace and security. Climate change, left unchecked, will roll back the development gains we have made over the last decades and will make further gains impossible.  The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) outlined some agreements in terms of the global agenda on climate change for the next decade and the\nCountries agreed to:\nmeet further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide to try to keep temperate rises within 1.5oC\nreduce the use of coal\nincrease money to poor countries to help with effects of climate change\nphase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or natural gas\nUS and China to cooperate and switch to clean energy\nstop deforestation by 2030\nClimate change impacts our food in terms of weather conditions such as increase in temperatures and rain fall which impact the quality of our foods, such as flooding the fields and destroying the crops.  Mortality rates can increase due to impact of food availability and can limit worker productivity.  Flooding can spread disease and damage the ecosystem and therefore, lowering emissions is believed to be one of the biggest impacts on lessening harmful impacts to health. \nIn 2021, the UN reported that more than 59 million people were displaced within their homelands through weather related events such as floods, storms and cyclones. \n\nFigure 4:  Unocha:  A displaced persons camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nOrganisations that revisit production practices and work on reducing emissions through good practices will help overcome some of the challenges with climate change.  Governments can help address social problems such as through global financial markets, climate and the internet and therefore there are many areas of business that are not explicitly regulated.  There is expectation that businesses will address these volatile financial markets, consider climate change during their production processes and consider issues such as internet privacy. \nRead the case study on page 133 of the core text “the politics of the oil sands” and the different stances of both the US and Canadian governments and the impact this is having on climate change.\n\nTopic 3\nPrevious\nNext\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nGoal 1\nEradicate extreme poverty and hunger\nGoal 2\nAchieve universal primary education\nGoal 3\nPromote gender equality and empower women\nGoal 4\nReduce child mortality\nGoal 5\nImprove maternal health\nGoal 6\nCombating HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other diseases\nGoal 7\nEnsure environmental sustainability\nGoal 8\nDevelop a global partnership for development\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as proposed by the OWG\nGoal 1Links to an external site.\nEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere\nGoal 2Links to an external site.\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture\nGoal 3Links to an external site.\nEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\nGoal 4Links to an external site.\nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all\nGoal 5Links to an external site.\nAchieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\nGoal 6Links to an external site.\nEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\nGoal 7Links to an external site.\nEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all\nGoal 8Links to an external site.\nPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all\nGoal 9Links to an external site.\nBuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation\nGoal 10Links to an external site.\nReduce inequality within and among countries\nGoal 11Links to an external site.\nMake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\nGoal 12Links to an external site.\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns\nGoal 13Links to an external site.\nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\nGoal 14Links to an external site.\nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development\nGoal 15Links to an external site.\nProtect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss\nGoal 16Links to an external site.\nPromote peaceful and inclus\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761c02-20564-Topic_4.docx ---\n4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.1 Introduction to Consumerism\n\nThe actions that consumers take have an impact other people and those impacts can be positive or negative.  This is an example of a tweet that appeared discussing some of the problems with Amazon’s same delivery service and the impacts this has on the workers to search for, find and deliver products and services the same day. There are also the environmental impacts such as additional pollution in the environment.  Read the tweet below and then consider the questions below:\n\nWhen you order something for same day delivery do you consider the impact this has on workers or the environment and if so, would it persuade you to consider not same day deliver?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\nv4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.2 Key Ethical Tensions\n\nOne of the key ethical tensions is between consumer rights versus the consequences of these activities.  The Declaration of Independence gave three examples of inalienable rights which were, to “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness”.  Sometimes these are known as natural rights.  Therefore, it is important to consider the following questions:\ndo consumers have a right to a product if the consequences of this are bad for society and/or the environment?\ndo consumers have a right to a product at a fair price?\ndo consumers have a duty to favour ethical companies in their purchasing decisions?\nObviously, the answer to some of these questions such as fair price is yes, however the consequences of this needs to be considered, e.g., is the fair price due to unfair labour practices such as child workers or paying below the minimum requirements then is it fair?\nConsumers have inalienable entitlements to fair treatment when entering into exchanges with sellers and there is a belief that consumer dignity should be respected.  Sellers have a duty to treat consumers as ends in themselves and not only as means to the end of the seller.  This should prevent misleading or deceptive practices and should aggregate social, cultural and environmental good practices.  These should therefore reduce inequality, exploitation, physical, emotional, mental and socio-cultural harm. \n\nThinking of tourism as an industry which includes human behaviour, the use of resources, communication with people, economies, the environment and the physical movement of the tourists to location impacts a number of different communities in both positive and negative ways. \nPositively tourism brings money into the community, can help with job creation, brings investment and triggers economic growth. \nNegatively it impacts the environment in terms of pollution, the ecosystem in terms of use of water taken e.g., for swimming pools from other needed community sources or through the clearing of vegetation for hotels and resorts to build these near beaches or in core areas of the forest.  Walking can trample and destroy coastlines leading to a loss of species and destruction of habitats.   Cultural diversity can also be reduced, and this is known as cultural homogenisation which refers to the reduction in cultural diversity through popularisation and diffusion of cultural symbols or customs, ideas and values which become absorbed by the dominant outside culture.\n An example of this is McDonalidization where fast food restaurants are dominating around the world meaning that the same health standards are being adopted across the world and therefore this can have a negative impact on health and are changing the food choices of the country before McDonalidization.\nCrane et al., 2019, identified a number of ethical issues for consumers within key industries as shown below:\n\nFigure 1:  Ethical issues for consumer within key industries.\nCan you think of any others? \nOrganisations need to deal with consumers ethical such as ensuring product safety and fitness for purpose or making sure during marketing activities there are no misleading claims or price fixing for example. \n\nOne of the issues that consumers criticise companies of is pricing.  Consumers want to purchase these as at the lowest cost, but companies want to sell these for the maximum amount to increase their revenue.  In most countries, regulatory agencies police price fixing – however the main issues that are arise are:\nExcessive pricing – price gouging – that the fair prices for goods and services has been exceeded.  This may be based on market conditions.\nPrice fixing – collusion between competing firms to fix prices above the market rate – this is illegal in Europe and US but other countries of the word it can go unnoticed.\nPredatory pricing – anticompetitive practice when firm sets the price significantly lower than market rate to force out the competition.\nDeceptive pricing – true cost is deliberately obscured and sometimes the airline industry has been found to advertise prices which are only available on a few flights with substantial booking restrictions and no information about the additional taxes or charges.\nHave you experienced any of these practices?  What do you think?  How ethical are these companies?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.3 Deontological and Teleological Ethics\n\nTwo theories can be applied to consumers and the consequences of actions.  The first is deontological ethics which applies to consumer rights as it provides an underlying principle of an action that is good or right?  It assumes that good decisions are made by adhering to ‘good’ principles and doing the right thing because it is the right thing to do.  If you follow rules and fulfil duties. \nDeontological ethics relies on the normative theory that morality of action is based on whether the action is right or wrong rather than based on the consequences of the action, for example do not kill, do not steal, follow religious beliefs and keep promises made. \nHowever, in contrast,  teleological ethics consider the consequences of actions and if they are morally the best (or consequentialist ethics).  For example, killing for promotion is wrong but killing in self-defence could be deemed as moral and the right decision made on the best consequences.  It therefore considers the outcome of the action good being good and whether the goal of the action or decision leads to good outcomes.  Overall, the better outcomes an action produces, the better it is.\nThis image shows the differences between the two:\n\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.4 Consumer Rights v Consequences of Consumption\n\nAs you have already started to see, consumers have various rights when purchasing goods and services and in the UK they are protected by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  This act gives the consumer a legal right to a refund for goods or services that are unsatisfactory or unfit for use or to get it repaired in certain circumstances.\nIn 2009, Tata Motors introduced a new model, The Tata Nano and described it as ‘The People’s Car’  with a price of around £1,075 at launch, with the price dropping by 30% within a year.  It was stated to be safer than alternative models of transport such as motorbikes, scooters, motor-rickshaws, and it was a lot cheaper.  It therefore potentially satisfied millions of lower-income people dream of owning a car. \nHowever, on the other hand, it was potentially ‘socially and environmentally disastrous’ as it was bringing countries to gridlock through increased traffic, pollution was impacted through the use of motor vehicles, damaging the environment.  In addition, the land for Nano factories had  been acquired controversially as some of the land had previously been the ‘most fertile’ farmland in locality.\nHowever, in 2010 reports emerged of fires in a handful of Nanos, amid wider concerns that cost-cutting made the car unreliable and safe, and it was discontinued in 2020 due to safety concerns. \nConsider the following question:\nDo people in developing countries have the right to products available to developed countries if these will have net negative consequences for society / the environment?\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.5 Turing Pharmaceuticals Unethical Practices\n\nThis was one of the questions highlighted earlier – do you think consumers do have the right to a fair price?\nConsumers do have the right to a fair price and as we have seen in earlier topics, employers and employees can conflict during the production process as employers want to minimise costs and maximise revenue through reduced costs such as lower wages resulting in tensions between consumers and producers to maximise this cost revenue.   An example of this is that in 2015, Martin Shkreli was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a 60-year-old life-saving drug by over 5000% overnight taking the costs from $13.50 to $750 in the USA and by comparison it costs $0.66 in the UK.  His company had a monopoly on the drug, and this was not the first-time aggressive pricing has been brought in.  However even 2.5 years later the price hadn’t changed but the company was trying to make it less expensive to hospitals.   He was solely motivated by profits and was successful as there was no alternative to the drug for low-income patients.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.6 Ethical Consumption\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.6 Ethical Consumption\n\nProfessor Craig Smith, in 1995 and 1996 published research relating to ethical consumption and how consumers were boycotting unethical companies showing how customers do take ethical considerations into purchasing decisions.    Thinking  back to the child workers and poor labour practices in the production of Primark’s clothing, customers could have boycotted Primark until they resolved these unethical practices.\nHowever, boycotting unethical companies was found not to be consistent, and companies could justify unethical consumption.  Think about chocolate production and how Fairtrade was introduced.  Fairtrade is about better prices, safe working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers.  Fairtrade ensures that workers are paid fairly and providing better terms of the farmers.  Would you boycott a company that was producing chocolate unethically?  Would the companies survive?\nIn perfect competition (where  in a market buyers and sellers are so numerous and well informed that all elements of monopoly are absent and the market price of a commodity is beyond the control of individual buyers and sellers), customer demand drives market. \nThis means that the customer is King, and the customers will move to a different seller if they are not satisfied.  Therefore, is consumer sovereignty the ‘Key’ to truly ethical consumption? \nA consumer sovereignty test can measure:\nconsumer capability to make free decisions without vulnerability or coercion.\nhow readily available, good quality information is relating to products.\nchoice between similar products with affordable switching costs.\nHaving the capability to choose between similar products, with good information about companies’ ethical stances enables consumers to make choices such as where there has been any animal testing, or the products have been produced in a sweatshop or used child labour.\n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.7 Disaster Capitalism and Investing in Sin\n\nDisaster capitalism refers to the development of profits based on some type of disaster.   For example, Donald Trump proposed a $700 billion dollar stimulus plan to eliminate payroll taxes which would lead to a reduction in social security funding.  Some other governors said that they wanted nothing to do with this plan as it was too expensive and how it would impact state and local funding as it was to divert the funds.  Sometimes, unethical conduct can pay more than ethical conduct, however in this case the plan was not implemented. \nAnother example is from Nathan Rothschild (c.1815), who said, “The best time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.”  He made his fortune buying in the panic following the Battle of Waterloo as the better the opportunities, the better the profit. \nHowever, Warren Buffet warned that you can pay a high price in the stock market, particularly if everyone agrees with your investment decision.   Therefore, where there is social and economic turmoil this results in an opportunity and can lead to prospective business deals.  Consumers and citizens maybe too tired or distracted of what is happening to resist the changes.  This leads to the debate about ethical and unethical behavior.\nDo you think it is ethical to profit from the pandemic? \nNews stories relating to the amount of government spending and the unethical contracts awarded by ministers has led to discussions relating to unethical behavior.  However, organisations such as Netflix and Amazon have clearly profited from the pandemic due to increased home shopping and people staying at home.   Billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic, with top executives from technology and industry earning the most. \nThe world's richest saw their wealth climb 27.5% to $10.2trn (£7.9trn) from April to July this year, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS.  That was up from the previous peak of $8.9trn at the end of 2017 and largely due to rising global share prices.  UBS said billionaires had done \"extremely well\" in the Covid crisis and it also said the number of billionaires had hit a new high of 2,189, up from 2,158 in 2017.  However, it is expected that 150 million people, have been predicted to fall into extreme poverty next year, due to climate change, war, and now the pandemic, which is a new record.\nDo you think that companies should be rewarded for doing the right thing?  Should we not punish them for doing the wrong thing?  Are they doing the wrong thing?\nThinking about fast fashion, which is a business model that relies on cheap and speedy production of low-quality clothing which is rapidly produced and cycled in and out of the market quickly to meet new trends.  \nFashion brand Zara, coined the phrase stating it took them only 15 days to design, produce and sell garments in their stores.  This allowed them to develop more styles and to differentiate their fashion garments at a lower price through cheap and rapid production which is an example of encouraging excessive consumption. \nTheir business model encourages consumers to purchase cheap clothing and discard them quickly creating environmental problems through accumulating mountains of textiles and clothing every day, which are not biodegradable.\n After the deaths of 1,134 people during the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh Aleya Akter, a local union leader, expressed concerns that raising working standards in the country would cause businesses to pull out from the country.  He suggested that, as much as workers blame the brands for letting things get so bad in the first place, the last thing they want is for the industry to disappear”. \nThere are about 4 million garment workers and it’s impossible for them to get work anywhere else, because this is what they’re skilled to do. Not only are we asking for compensation for the brands, but we are also asking them: Do not walk away from us. Do not walk away from Bangladesh.\"\nCan consumers claim that their demand for fast fashion is ethical because it leads to jobs and investment in the developing world? \n\nTopic 4\nPrevious\nNext\n4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 4 - Consumerism > 4.8 Pepsi Challenge: Cola Ethics\n\nStudy Activity\nIn the 1970s South Africa and Apartheid was a system where legislation upheld segregation policies against non-white citizens.  Government policies were developed that discriminated socially, economically and politically against black majority.  However, these unethical practices called for international economic sanctions against South Africa, though these were not fully enforced.  This resulted in ‘Ethical’ companies which ceased business and some less ethical businesses continued.  Apartheid ended in the 1990s when FW de Klerk (South African president), repealed most of the social legislation, however racial segregation remained due to deeply entrenched in society.  Nelson Mandela was a key antiapartheid activist and the countries first black president. \nCoca Cola.docx\nActions\n \n\nRead through Coke and Pepsi’s response to apartheid.

The Ethical Consumer article focuses on Amazon's negative impact, especially its unethical practices like poor treatment of workers, environmental damage, tax avoidance, and data misuse. It takes a critical ethical stance, encouraging people to think beyond cheap prices and question the company’s actions. This reflects the moral absolutist or deontological stance mentioned in the lecture, where actions are judged as right or wrong regardless of the results.\nOn the other hand, the MoneySavingExpert article is more focused on deals and savings. It doesn’t talk about ethics—it simply helps people get the best prices on Amazon. This matches the consequentialist stance, where the outcome (saving money) is more important than how the company behaves.\nMy View on Amazon and Ethical Shopping:\nPersonally, I use Amazon sometimes, but I do feel uncomfortable about many of its practices, like worker mistreatment and avoiding taxes. I believe in ethical shopping, but I also know it’s not always easy or affordable. I try to buy from better companies when I can, especially for clothes, food, and home items.\nYes, I think some things are serious enough to boycott a company, like:\nModern slavery\nAnimal cruelty\nEnvironmental harm\nMistreating workers on purpose\nIf I know a company does these things and doesn’t try to improve, I would stop supporting them.

a stakeholder in business\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.2 Government as a stakeholder in business\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, the government acts as the representative of citizens, and is expected to define the conditions which business must meet in order to operate, for example:\nWhat environmental laws to follow\nThe level of corporate taxation that organisations need to pay and.\nWhether one large company can merge with another\nThe aim of the government is to be re-elected, not just to serve its citizens and therefore is made up be elected individuals and these individuals have noble aims as they want to be re-elected in the future.  Their interests usually align with business to make business strong which should result in a booming economy, happy people with jobs and them having an income to spend across the community.  However they are also able to influence by competition in terms of education, health and entertainment such as through local authority owned theatres vs commercially owned or charitable theatres. \nThis image gives an outline as the government as a stakeholder of business:\n\n \nFigure 1:  Government as a stakeholder of business (Crane, et al., 2019, p482)\nOn the left-hand side of the image you will see that the government in principle represents an entire community since it is elected by the citizens of a certain town, region, country or even continent.  In this role as the elected representative of citizens’ interests.  This means that they define the conditions for the licence to operate of business as well as restricting and enabling business.  There is some debate about the degree of governmental responsibility for a functioning economy for example such as through laissez-faire vs. forceful role in industrial policy. \nOn the right hand of the image, the government have a self-interest to be re-elected and therefore they are very dependent on business and also compete with business.  In March 2022, the UK government has published significant reform proposals to drive change in competition and consumer law policy with the aim of boosting trade following Brexit.\nIt could be argued that the government has a conflict of interest between creating jobs and regulating business interests.  This image from Crane and Matten (2019) shows some of these relations and conflicts of interest as well as identifying some of the main sources of ethical problems which stem from fiduciary relation to society in general. \nThis shows Society on the right and the Government in the middle who are setting the standards and regulations in the UK to provide a stable environment for businesses to operate within. On the Right and in this stable environment business provides the taxes eg corporation, VAT etc to the government through providing employment and good work leading to growth in the economy.  Through business activities the government reviews how they can protect citizens in society such as through environmental regulations, paternity leave, minimum wage and other employment regulation and interventions.  These are signals from the government that they are looking after citizens and ensuring business protect Society.  However, the government are caught in the middle of conflicting demands in a bipolar situation.\n\nFigure 2:  Government between business and society interests (Crane et al, 2019, p.486)\nTherefore here we can see that business can have significant impact and influence on the implementation of government policies and business influence legitimacy and accountability are questioned.  Business can expect stable legal and economic frameworks, however if these demands interfere too much with their activities and leads to irresponsible lobbying and scrutiny in terms of accountability. \n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.3 Government choice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.3 Government choice\n\nStudy Activity\nSo governments have a choice in where they position themselves.   \nDo you think that the government is:\nPro business?\nFairness to workers?\nFairness to consumers?\nHow to balance these aspects?\nInterventionist or laissez faire?\nCan you think of any examples of each of these different choices that the government has to make?  Make a list of examples.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.4 Legitimacy of business influence\n\nThe main ethical consideration arising from this situation is twofold as identified above:\nlegitimacy of business influence;\naccountability (Crane et al.,, 2019)\nBusinesses look to influence to government or public policy through legitimacy of business influences through corporate political activity and they do this through activities such as lobbying, political advertising, financial contributions, legal action and political campaigning.  \nYou will hear in the news how business have paid for government campaigns or have funded political parties in ways to lobby the government. \nFor example one of top Tory Party Donors in the UK in 2022 is JCB who donated over £2.5 million whilst Boris Johnson has been in power.  JCB Chairman has access to Boris Johnson’s top team as part of an elite “advisory board” who lobbied for early relaxation of lockdown measures inn 2020 and tax benefits for high net-worth individuals.  Others have been given public appointments or honours through giving donations.  Therefore business can have a significant influence on the implementation and direction of governmental policies. It is therefore no surprise that the issue of ‘public sector ethics has gained enormous momentum (Dobel 2007).\nIn terms of accountability to the public, one may contend that since the government acts as a representative of society’s interests, the public has a right to be informed about governmental decisions with other constituencies (such as business) and be able to determine whether it is acting in its interests or not.  Both parties are able to influence each other, the main concerns for business ethics are where business has influence on government.  There are numerous ways that business can influence government and Oberman (cited in Getz 1997, p59) distinguishes among different ways, using following criteria as to whether it is:\nThis gives different approaches to influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in 2008-9 as it had so many officials that had worked there from government posts.\nJapan has a tradition known as ‘Amakudari’, which means that Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high profile positions going into private and public sectors.  It means “descent from heaven”.  This example proved that in Japan, many contracts went to 70% of firms with links (no contest) to previous government bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you place these countries in (least corrupt first)?\nUSA\nRwanda\nDenmark\nSomalia\nColombia\nItaly\nUK\nClick here to reveal the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.6 Contemporary issues\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.6 Contemporary issues\n\nDuring the 1980s, the government in UK and USA started to privatise public industries such as telecommunication, rail and utilities for example.   In addition in the 1990s following the end of the USSR and the development of post-soviet transition from communism to capitalism there was massive scale investment in these countries which you have seen is where the growth of globalisation has come from.\nIn 2013, the Post Office in the UK was floated on the stock exchange through selling shares to private investors.  Representations from the firm, Lazard, were paid £1.5m by the government for flotation advice relating to the Post Office.  They followed their own recommendations and bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p to reap a profit of £8.4m.  Is this ethical?    One could argue no and their profit was based on insider information.\nDuring the pandemic we have seen that normal procurement rules were suspended and therefore this was open to cronyism. \nA report by the BMJ in 2021, identified that 1/5th of all UK government contracts contained a “red flag” which were indicators of possible corruption.   These contracts were worth £3.7 bn and it was identified that companies bidding for contracts were channeled through “VIP” or “high priority” channels because of their political connection and 30 contracts were awarded to companies with connections to the Conversative Party.  Is this ethical?\nGlobalization has made companies arguably more powerful than many governments.   Thinking about Amazon which is at no.55 if it was a country – ahead of oil rich Qatar and Walmart is bigger than Belgium.   Globalisation has enabled organisations to develop into poorer countries for example increasing their footprint in many countries, resulting in improving democracy to corrupting failed states to all in between.\nWhat moral duty do they have? \nFor example, Amazon and other organisation are able to avoid one tax regime in favour of another and the issue of trade and tariffs become paramount. \nIncreasingly, action on the environment is global and there is less room to hide.  You have to ask, what is the point of profiting in the next 10 years? \nBusinesses complained for centuries about red tape, and they are now making noise on ‘green tape’.  Oil companies spend $150m per year on lobbying against carbon reduction, $190 m saying they are the good guys, and $115bn on new extraction (3% on low carbon). \nHow ethical is this?\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.7 Activity 1 - Ethical Practices Case Study\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable

The key unethical behaviors mentioned in the paper include:\nFalse advertising – Companies give wrong or misleading information to customers to increase sales.\nExploitation of workers – Some firms underpay workers, give poor working conditions, or ignore labor rights.\nBribery and corruption – Businesses use bribes to win contracts or avoid legal rules.\nEnvironmental violations – Some companies ignore environmental laws and pollute just to cut costs.\nTax evasion – Firms avoid paying taxes through unfair or illegal means.\nThese unethical actions hurt not just the company’s image but also the market and the people. For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems. That’s why I believe ethical business is not only the right thing to do but also important for long-term success.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n28 May 17:09| Last reply 30 May 9:12\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the article by Rai and Deo (2017), it’s clear that some businesses still engage in really questionable behaviour. The paper talks about companies lying to customers through false advertising, treating workers unfairly, and using bribes to get ahead. What stood out to me was how common it still is for businesses to ignore environmental rules or avoid taxes just to save money. These actions might help them in the short term, but they seriously damage trust in the long run. Customers stop buying from brands they don’t believe in, employees become unhappy, and honest businesses find it harder to compete. It also puts a bad image on the whole industry. I think businesses need to realist that ethics and success go hand in hand—cutting corners might work for a while, but it always catches up with them.\n \n I completely agree with what you said about

influencing the government  such as through direct or indirect measures through talking to people directly or running adverts or writing articles which will influence the government ministers. \nBreadth of transmission.  Influence can be public and visible to all, or it can be private where politicians are approached behind closed doors.\nContent of communication.  Politicians can be influenced through informed, or pressure orientated methods.  Informed methods would focus on persuading the decision makers through the information provided.  Pressure orientated methods would involve more coercive types of approaches (Crane et al., 2019)\nOne of the concerns in the UK has been about ethical lobbying and there have been numerous cases of unethical lobbying such as “cash for questions” where conservative MPs were accused of accepting cash for asking particular questions in parliament and the government is in a precarious position ensuring that it makes the right decisions for both society and business.  This makes the government look bad by allowing this to happen and it has been suggested that parliament needs a good clean up.\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.5 Lobbying\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.5 Lobbying\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying earlier, however there are different forms which include lobbying, party financing, overlap of posts, state ‘capture’ (explain) and privatization of govt functions. \nFor example there are direct lobbying approaches where there is a private attempt by business actors to influence governmental decision-making through information provision and persuasion.   This has been considered a weak form of influence (McGrath 2005) and a recent example of this is where David Cameron, previous UK prime minster worked at Greensill Capital in 2018 as a part-time senior advisor.  He texted the former PM Rishi Sunak as to whether Greensill could access emergency government COVID loans, and it was rumoured that Cameron held private drinks with Matt Hancock (Health Secretary) and Lex Greensill. \nCameron said this was not a breach of code of conduct or government rules, however he did agree he should have used the formal channels.  Greensill did not receive any money through the Corporate Financing Facility.  This is an example of direct lobbying but also unethical practices as how many individuals would have access to Rishi Sunaks’ mobile number?\nSome other different types of lobbying include:\nAtmosphere setting – hosting dinners, exhibitions, fairs, visits etc\nMonitoring – hearing what government plans are in the pipeline\nProviding of Information to policy-makers – telling government about trends and issues\nAdvocacy & influencing – expertise/consultancy to ‘find solutions’\nApplication of Pressure – warnings of consequences of policy actions\nThe news has numerous unethical lobbying examples in the press and in November 2021, the UK government were accused of corruption after it was revealed they backed a colleague who broke paid lobbying rules.  The MP in question was suspended due to committing an “egregious case of paid advocacy” by repeatedly using his position to promote two different companies which paid him nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/uks-conservatives-accused-of-corruption-over-mp-suspension-voteLinks to an external site.).   \nWe have seen that Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative party in July 2022 due to corruption and unethical behaviours, but it took a number of incidents to be aired before he decided to resign.   One of the biggest examples in the USA was from 2009 where Big Oil were spending a reported $169 million lobbying in the USA to block action to tackle climate change.   \nHow do you feel about the lobbying, and do you think it should be allowed?\nStudy Activity\nInfluence through Political Funding\nIt is illegal for corporations to donate directly to government candidates or parties in the US and during recent presential elections it was reported that almost $2bn had been spent in 2016 with Clinton outspending Trump through political funding their presidential campaign. \nHowever in the UK there are limits which have to be declared and in 2017, the four biggest parties declared nearly £36 million with stakeholders trying to influence the government actions.  In 2019 the Conservative government received £6m with Labour receiving £5m from trade unions and it shows that government activities are still be funded by stakeholders trying to influence the government.\nThere are rewards but also risks in these lobbying and funding strategies as some business see that they may lose reputation if they fund a party that then looses the election. \nFrom an ethical point of view the risks are clear.  How about from a corporate point of view?\nIn 2002, BP (Blair Petroleum) decided to scrap all political donations as criticism mounted related to their corporate information on government policy following the Enron collapse.  The Chairman said that BP needed to be careful because of legitimacy in the political process and they had decided not to make political contributions anymore as they felt it was crucial for them as a company, for society and for them working in that society to be removed from any comments about unethical practices.  However BP said they would still engage in policy debate to help the development of ideas but would not fund any political activities. \nSo what is the significance of this?\nCurrently government advisers move from industry, then back to industry as we have seen in Cameron example above.  When they are no longer politicians, they move to industry.  An example of an organisation where this was evident was Goldman Sachs which became known as Government Sachs in 2008-9 as it had so many officials that had worked there from government posts.\nJapan has a tradition known as ‘Amakudari’, which means that Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high profile positions going into private and public sectors.  It means “descent from heaven”.  This example proved that in Japan, many contracts went to 70% of firms with links (no contest) to previous government bureaucrats and only 18% were not blessed with these high profile bureaucrats when they had retired and this was deemed to be unethical practices.\nThinking about corruption:\nWhich order would you place these countries in (least corrupt first)?\nUSA\nRwanda\nDenmark\nSomalia\nColombia\nItaly\nUK\nClick here to reveal the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.6 Contemporary issues\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable Business > 5.6 Contemporary issues\n\nDuring the 1980s, the government in UK and USA started to privatise public industries such as telecommunication, rail and utilities for example.   In addition in the 1990s following the end of the USSR and the development of post-soviet transition from communism to capitalism there was massive scale investment in these countries which you have seen is where the growth of globalisation has come from.\nIn 2013, the Post Office in the UK was floated on the stock exchange through selling shares to private investors.  Representations from the firm, Lazard, were paid £1.5m by the government for flotation advice relating to the Post Office.  They followed their own recommendations and bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p to reap a profit of £8.4m.  Is this ethical?    One could argue no and their profit was based on insider information.\nDuring the pandemic we have seen that normal procurement rules were suspended and therefore this was open to cronyism. \nA report by the BMJ in 2021, identified that 1/5th of all UK government contracts contained a “red flag” which were indicators of possible corruption.   These contracts were worth £3.7 bn and it was identified that companies bidding for contracts were channeled through “VIP” or “high priority” channels because of their political connection and 30 contracts were awarded to companies with connections to the Conversative Party.  Is this ethical?\nGlobalization has made companies arguably more powerful than many governments.   Thinking about Amazon which is at no.55 if it was a country – ahead of oil rich Qatar and Walmart is bigger than Belgium.   Globalisation has enabled organisations to develop into poorer countries for example increasing their footprint in many countries, resulting in improving democracy to corrupting failed states to all in between.\nWhat moral duty do they have? \nFor example, Amazon and other organisation are able to avoid one tax regime in favour of another and the issue of trade and tariffs become paramount. \nIncreasingly, action on the environment is global and there is less room to hide.  You have to ask, what is the point of profiting in the next 10 years? \nBusinesses complained for centuries about red tape, and they are now making noise on ‘green tape’.  Oil companies spend $150m per year on lobbying against carbon reduction, $190 m saying they are the good guys, and $115bn on new extraction (3% on low carbon). \nHow ethical is this?\n\nTopic 5\nPrevious\nNext\n5.7 Activity 1 - Ethical Practices Case Study\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 5 – Practicing Sustainable

The key unethical behaviors mentioned in the paper include:\nFalse advertising – Companies give wrong or misleading information to customers to increase sales.\nExploitation of workers – Some firms underpay workers, give poor working conditions, or ignore labor rights.\nBribery and corruption – Businesses use bribes to win contracts or avoid legal rules.\nEnvironmental violations – Some companies ignore environmental laws and pollute just to cut costs.\nTax evasion – Firms avoid paying taxes through unfair or illegal means.\nThese unethical actions hurt not just the company’s image but also the market and the people. For example, customers lose trust in the brand, and they may stop buying from the company. Workers feel demotivated, and loyal employees may leave. It also creates unfair competition for honest companies, making the whole industry look bad.\nIn the long run, these unethical practices can damage the company's reputation, reduce profits, and even lead to legal problems. That’s why I believe ethical business is not only the right thing to do but also important for long-term success.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n28 May 17:09| Last reply 30 May 9:12\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the article by Rai and Deo (2017), it’s clear that some businesses still engage in really questionable behaviour. The paper talks about companies lying to customers through false advertising, treating workers unfairly, and using bribes to get ahead. What stood out to me was how common it still is for businesses to ignore environmental rules or avoid taxes just to save money. These actions might help them in the short term, but they seriously damage trust in the long run. Customers stop buying from brands they don’t believe in, employees become unhappy, and honest businesses find it harder to compete. It also puts a bad image on the whole industry. I think businesses need to realist that ethics and success go hand in hand—cutting corners might work for a while, but it always catches up with them.\n \n I completely agree with what you said about how unethical behavi\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213761f1a-20564-Topic_6.docx ---\n6.1 Perception of Facebook and Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.1 Perception of Facebook and Ethics\n\nFacebook was set up by Mark Zuckerberg with the mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and it could be argued that he has achieved this to some extent.  However they have been criticised for the way they use personal data, viewing history and their lack of safety at times. \nPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have pledged to give 99% of their wealth away via their eponymous initiative.  You might have read their letter to their daughter which appeared on Facebook just after she was born, and they also pledged to work towards no disease by the end of the century. \nYou’re probably familiar with Bill and Melinda Gates and their work on AIDS in Africa. \nThese are inspiring examples of how businesspeople use their wealth, created from personal sacrifice, hard work, and innovation, to help others.  However it isn’t always what it seems for example,  Facebook’s company base is in Ireland where corporate tax is 12.5% in comparison to Britain at 20%.  Any money the company has made has been routed from the UK through Ireland resulting in them only paying €3.4m in corporate taxes.  Facebook Ireland makes little profit because it makes huge royalty payments for using Facebook technology to another Irish company called Facebook Holdings Limited which is also based in Ireland, although its tax domicile is in the Cayman Islands which is tax-free.  This tax trick is known as the “double-Irish”.    In 2019 Facebook’s turnover in the UK was £1.6bn.  A relatively miserly 5% profit margin would have resulted in profits of £800m, and yet their declared profits were just £97m.\nHere we have another view of business, one in which the businessperson does all it possibly can to avoid paying what it rightfully should, stripping (for example) the UK of its citizens’ wealth, and stopping our government from tackling  poverty, disease and improving education.  This tax arrangement is said to have ended but we haven’t yet seen how much tax Facebook will pay.\nFacebook are not alone at these practices for example other Tech Giants such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and Cisco Systems have between them only paid £191m in taxes in the UK in 2017.  This was on a combined turnover of £23.42bn and estimated profits of £6.62bn, which would have meant them paying £1.068bn more than they did. \nIt could be argued that Britain’s businesses are sometimes misaligned with those of other stakeholders such as employees, customers, service users and local authorities. \nCo-operatives were established to achieve specific or organisational goals to share both risk and reward which means that they are more democratic and accountable and can’t sell equity on capital markets to influence shareholding conglomerates.  Recent studies have shown them to be more enduring and resilient in the face of market dispution, more profitable and more productive (Co-ops unleashed, 2022).\nHowever Britain’s top five co-operatives paid more in tax in 2016 than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks combined as shown in the image below:\n\nFigure 1:  Comparison of tax contributions (SEUK, 2018)\n\nIt is worth just reiterating what we mean by some key concepts in the economy and pointing to some differences.   As you will be aware the economy is split into two sectors –\nPrivate and Public:\nPrivate sector - Independent entities, owned by individuals or shareholders, and who are dependent on customers with outcome of being profit-driven\nPublic sector - Part of a larger whole and owned by the state, national or local. They are answerable to government and voters and have a clear social purpose\nPrivate companies are separate bodies.  They may of course take multiple forms, as we see from mergers and acquisitions all the time, but the very term corporation is derived from the Latin corpus which means body.  They are owned by one person, a few people, many people, or even by other corporations in the form of corporate investors etc.  They may be sole traders, owned and managed by one person, or the management may be appointed to run the company on behalf of the shareholders.  They are of course subject to the law of the land, but their duty is to shareholders, and their performance of that duty is dependent on how well they serve their customers. This generates profit, which is the primary purpose.\nWe can all think of public sector bodies, for example, the Job Centre, the local hospital, even the police or army.  Using that latter example, while the army is distinct from the navy or the air force, they are expected to pursue common objectives.  The armed forces collectively are also part of the state, along with all its other constituents, and they are all meant to be pulling in the same direction.  That direction is decided not by the market, but by governments, which are, of course, elected every 5 years, or more frequently at local level.  They have in common that private profit should not be their primary purpose.  However lean or efficient they might be, the profit (or savings made) is recycled elsewhere in the system rather than shared amongst a few owners.\nMost countries in the world operate a 'mixed economy', consisting of for-profit enterprises, and state-owned organisations.  These two parts of the economy are often referred to as the private and public sectors and are calibrated in different proportions in different states.  For example, in Denmark around 35% of jobs are in the public sector, while in South Korea the figure is only 7.6% (OECD, 2015). \nIn the UK, around 28 million people work in the private sector, which is almost 84% of the entire workforce (ONS, 2018).  There are 5.7 million businesses, which range in size from one person operations ('sole traders') to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) which employ from 10-250 people, up to large national and international corporations.  However, an additional 'third' sector also exists, made up of organisations and associations which are both separate from government and motivated by social objectives rather than private profit.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\nv6.2 The Third Sector\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.2 The Third Sector\n\nSo let’s compare third sector organisations (TSOs) with other sectors, using the features we looked at just now. \nThey are independent of the state, although they might get some funding from local or the national government, or they may be contracted by the NHS to do some work.  They are subject to the law as we all are.  But the government cannot (or should not) tell TSOs what to do. \nSo who owns them?\nThe confusing answer is that for the most part, no-one does, and everyone does. \nIf you look at charities, they are generally overseen by a board of what are called trustees.  They are responsible for directing things, and liable if things go wrong, but they don’t usually get paid, and they don’t share in any profit or surplus.  By the way, day to day management and operations are carried out by paid staff.  It’s not all voluntary. \nBusinesses answer to customers, the government to voters, TSOs to a diverse range of stakeholders, who can have a financial interest such as donors, grant givers, consumers (if they have shops, say) or businesses (if they sell services), even people who are about to die and make a bequest.  But they also answer to communities, and above all to the people or cause they serve.  A charity for disabled adults which wins substantial funding, runs efficiently, and employs dozens of staff will still potentially fail if they don’t serve their beneficiaries properly.\nAbove all, TSOs are motivated by this ‘serve’ mentality.  Social aims such as relief of poverty, protecting the environment, widening access to education, promoting healthy lifestyles, etc. They can’t lose money, or they’ll fail, but making a profit is not their purpose.\nThree key words for the constituents of this sector:\nCharity\nSocial Enterprises (recently rebranded Co-op group is our largest in this country), and\nVoluntary Organisations – the thousands of small entities like sports clubs, allotment societies, self-help groups, tenant’s associations and so on.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.3 Some Definitions of TSOs\n\n“The third sector includes organisations that:\nExist primarily for a social purpose\nAre independent of the state\nRe-invest financial surpluses in their services\nThe boundaries with the public and private sectors are not clear-cut and over time, organisations move across the boundaries.” \nThis is from Mike Hudson’s book Managing Without Profit. \nTraces history of charity (from a Greek word meaning favour, grace, kindness), which he argues goes back to earliest civilisations, whether it’s in Ancient Egypt, where ferries gave free passage to poor people, the Jewish or Muslim traditions of donating a proportion of your income to the needy, or Christian monks establishing the first hospitals here in England. \nIn many ways the first golden era for charity and philanthropy was the 19th Century, when many ‘household name’ charities were first established (Salvation Army, Barnardo’s, the RNLI, RSPCA, the Red Cross).  This continued up to the 1940s, when government (in the war and after) sought to replace many welfare services previously provided by charity.  Since the 1970s this process has been reversed, and the third sector delivers many public sector contracts, and had an income of over £100 bn in 2008.\nHudson points out the contested nature of the sector’s boundaries.  I would disagree with him, for example, that social enterprises form part of the private sector, as they are driven by social purpose and don’t distribute profits privately.\n\n“A useful way to define the third sector (and social economy) is that it comprises organisations where ‘shares’ of social wealth) are allocated to people in proportion to their needs and activities rather than property (private) or political (public) rights.” - A second definition from Ridley-Duff and Bull, 2011: p17\n\nRidley-Duff and Bull take a more wide-ranging, academic, and radical approach.  They highlight the fact that charitable activity predated the existence of the capitalist system, which only became properly established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nThey also point up two tensions within the third sector:\nNon-profit approach based primarily on giving, versus the ‘more than profit’ approach where SEs trade but do good things with their profits.\nSome organisations, most notably but not exclusively co-operatives, are based on principles of democratic control by members. For example a disability charity where the strategy is set by and for its beneficiaries or service users.  Others are run by one group of people for the good of others, with less democratic input from those they serve.\nThey set social purpose as the key definition, but neglect to mention independence explicitly.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.4 So what's a charity?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.4 So what's a charity?\n\nLet’s start with a charity.  Charity legislation in England goes back to 1603, and there are charities which still exist today which go back still further – there’s an alms house in Winchester which has been going since 1132. \nRoyal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) started in 1868.  Their purpose in a nutshell relates to the welfare of blind and partially sighted people, and the prevention of blindness.  Last year they spent over £123m which puts them in just about the top 20 in the UK.  They helped 17,000 people via sight loss advisers, over 60,000 with general advice, 12,000 with welfare advice, provided 20,000 talking books, and campaigned for safer streets, among other things.  They have 1500 employees and 4800 volunteers resulting in a wage bill of about £60m, and it is confirmed that the CEO earns around £150,000.\nSo charities can be big business. \nIn football club terms RNIB is like Everton or West Ham, in high street terms, a White Stuff.\n\nTopic 6\n6.5 Social Enterprises\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.5 Social Enterprises\n\n\nThe difference between social enterprise and charity is that social enterprises get most of their income from trading, but they are still motivated by social impact more than private profit.  And here’s examples of a social enterprise or two. \nLighthouse furniture is in Towieland, Brentwood.  They stop furniture going to landfill and provide low-cost furniture for low-income families so having two social aims.  They have just over 800k turnover, 80 odd employees and volunteers, and dramatic growth as they’ve doubled in size in 5 years.\nQuadrant here in Chelmsford is part of Chelmsford Star Co-operative, which has a £100m (Like a Burnley level) turnover retail co-operative owned by its customers.  They are committed to co-operative principles including democracy (members elect the board) and supporting the local community (equivalent of 20% of profits donated to good causes).\n \nConfusingly social enterprises can be charities too.  Lighthouse is one.  But Chelmsford Star isn’t.\nThere are some statistics below:\nYou can see that charity numbers, at least in E&W are fairly static, social enterprises are growing in number (and that growth is partly reflected in growth in co-ops). \nWe can’t leave this section with introducing food backs which have grown considerably across the UK particularly in 2022 and the cash crisis.  Food banks have seen their donations skyrocket by 5000% a month in 2020 with the average donation of approximately £1900.  The needs for foodbanks has grown across the UK and those that need access to this service can through vetting procedures.  This is an area of social enterprise that has significantly increased over the last few years.\nEton College\n\nEton College is a school in Eton, Berkshire in England and was founded in 1440 by Henry VI.  It has famously been attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, and other senior conservative prime ministers, for example.  However they have designated registered charity status.  Their charitable income includes fees, as these are raised in support of their purpose: education. \nThe fees are  £12,354 per term and therefore should they be a charity? \nFees, then generated £42m for the school and it has 646 employees and NO volunteers.  During the year 277 boys (21%) received fee reductions; 70 of these boys paid no fees at all. The equivalent figures for the previous year were 277 and 64. the amount spent on fee remission increased from £5,773k to £6,084k with the average award remaining 64% of the full fee.  It has £300m of assets, mainly property and investments.\nIn comparison, the Royal National Lifebook Institution (RNLI) is one of the biggest charities in the UK.  They are funded through donations, grants, legacies and account for £174m of its income of £192m.  It has 2200 employees and 33,000 volunteers.  It has saved 329 lives and helped 42,000 people in 2019.\nWhy should a charity do this?\nIs there any reason why the same could not apply to government bodies too? \nCSOs have a tradition of campaigning for legal reform, and against unfair policies or laws.  However, there are strict limits on charities, for example, campaigning for a particular party in an election\nHere are some ways in which CSOs take on this role:\nIndirect action often takes the form of research, communications, information, raising awareness about activities which are not seen as ethical.  So for example, an anti-obesity charity would campaign in the media and social media against fast food or soft drinks companies, as part of its general work. \nDirect action is riskier, can be violent (unlikely) or non-violent in nature.  If violent it is more likely to be property than people who get damaged.  But a group called SHAC (NOT registered charity) attacked Huntingdon Life Sciences with threats, violence and vandalism. They only stopped in 2014, after 15 years.  More often it’s like we see here with the Greenpeace boat in an earlier lesson.  However some of the ways they can cause disruption is through demonstrations, marches, letters, occupations, and boycotts.\nBoycotts are a form of ethical consumption, and organised refusal to buy services or goods.  So they:\nChange a policy\nGet a buzz around or against a company more generally\nCommunicate disapproval\nOr punish the company in their pockets\nIs this always a negative?  Can it be good for companies in the long run?\nCSOs or TSOs can challenge government as well as business. \nAnd of course the government can regulate and control business and TSOs in return.  However business complain of red tape, and charities find some of these regulations as e over burdensome such as having to report requirements attached to funding.  They also support and enable TSOs to thrive and here are some of the things being ‘traded’ between government and the sector. \nThe government is committed to tackling obesity, and charities exist with the same agenda.  They may not always agree, but some policy will chime with TSO campaigns. \nThe government can also provide a legislative framework broadly supportive of TSOs, which TSOs can support back.  If the government promotes volunteering, TSOs and CSOs can host events through providing volunteers.  This helps the government meet its own objectives (and maybe save money?)\nFinancially, in various ways: through buying their services; granting funds for projects or research; and lending, perhaps via social finance (more in a minute) .  In return, public trust (charities trusted more than govt, still), agility, flexibility, social innovation, access to ‘hard to reach’ people.\n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.6 Government Policy \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.6 Government Policy \n\nThe government launched Big Society Capital (BSC) in April 2012. Its purpose is to provide wholesale funding (investments, repayable) for charities and social enterprises to grow in scale, use as working capital, and buy assets to generate income.  Started with £120m, made up of ‘sorry money’ from UK banks, and money from dormant bank accounts.  By 2015, over 250 charities and social enterprise had accessed finance (from intermediaries) that BSC provided, which resulted in a total of £195m, of which BSC accounted for £68m from its own cash.\nThe conservative government proposed the Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support Bill) in 2021 and is currently passing through parliament.  This bill was to assess the benefits and effectiveness of TSOs and provide to support organisation’s function.    You can read more about this proposed bill here - Third Sector Organisations (Impact and Support) Bill (parliament.uk)Links to an external site.. \nThe National Citizen Service (NCS) encourages socially meaningful volunteering and participation by young people.  Piloted by a social enterprise with 100 odd people in 2009, the government adopted it in 2010 and since then over 200,000 have signed up.  Clearly has an impact on the third sector.  It was mainly set up to encourage 16–17-year-olds to volunteer during the summer after their GCSEs.  \nThe conservative government introduced the “big society” plan in 2010 to empower communities, however it was ill-fated and was disbanded mainly due to the fact that it lacked funding and support.   The government now wants people to have a say at local level in terms of getting better facilities using a cross sector approach which is not just up to local government.  However for the social sector there is no big new pot of money and the total spend due to austerity measures has been in significant decline and many community projects have been abandoned. \nThe government launched the Social Value Act which came into force in 2013 with aim of ensuring wider social, economic and environmental benefits.  This allowed the government to ensure that contracts would be awarded to organisations where their social values could be evaluated, and the government departments would then report on the social impact of these contracts.  The Social Value Model provides a consistent approach for the departments to streamline and standardise the procurement process. \nLet’s now think about how business interacts more positively with CSOs.  Here are some ways.\n\nFigure 3:  How Business interacts with CSOs.\nOn the right of this image are some of the ‘paybacks’ the third sector can offer for these interactions such as through joint ventures and the sense of ‘exchange’ is greater and more formalised in the bottom half of this image. \nWe’re familiar with the great entrepreneurs and giving.  \nCarnegie was a captain of industry or robber baron depending on your viewpoint, made a fortune in steel in the 19th century in the US, sold out for $480 million, which is $310 billion today.  One of the richest men who ever lived, gave $350 million away.   He killed strikers in his steel plants and was responsible for the worst manmade disaster in US history at the South Fork Dam.  However, he built 3000 libraries, a university and his final $30 million was donated in his will to institutions, charities and pensioners.  \nHow do we place this along with modern individual figures like Gates and Zuckerberg in the context of business ethics? \nMore recently, an expectation is that companies themselves ‘give something back’.  For example, a firm has an office in Chelmsford, where its Foundation is also based.  It had profits in 2018 of £121m and it spent less than £1m on the foundation, although technically they don’t have to give it.  A further example is Omaze which is a fundraising platform which has enabled over 300 charities to raise over £100m.  They give back by doing world-changing work such as creating after school programmes for 17,000 children in Los Angeles or through raising funds for disaster relive in California fires.   Each year the entire organisation takes a break from their office jobs for an annual day of service where they volunteer with a local non-profit organisation and give back to the community.  Organisations in the UK are also doing this, and they reward their staff for community based voluntary activities.\nWhere would this fit in ethical theories? \nVery much a teleological approach – there is a purpose behind it.  You could say it was egotistical – the company doing good for its own purposes.   Hasn’t even been completely demonstrated that (e.g.) profits are linked to CSR.  So why bother? It can help with long term revenues, reduced costs, managing risk and uncertainty and maintaining the social licence to operate.\nCompanies who are seen as socially responsible might attract more customers, and irresponsible ones are likely to lose them, and their employees might be more productive.  For example, a focus on sustainability leads to reduced costs by saving energy or cutting down on waste and acting responsibly, and being perceived to do so, can reduce government interventions, and potentially prevent bad practice and associated costs.  Also it allows the company to operate, and potentially contributes to a stable, peaceful, and equitable environment in which to do so. \n\nTopic 6\nPrevious\nNext\n6.7 Activity 1 – What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 6 – Business, Civil Society & The Third Sector > 6.7 What changes could be made to the Third Sector?\n\nDiscussion Activity - Contribute to the discussion\nThird sector and charitable organisations such as food banks have grown through Covid and current cash crisis in the UK.  Many governments funded projects are short-term and output focussed which fails to meet the needs or support citizens and communities and therefore sustainability is key for these organisations.\nThinking about your own experience of third sector organisations or through research how do you think Third Sector organisations can diversify their income, work more agile and work more with government policymakers to improve the lives of people in crisis?\nPost your comments  to the forum and respond to one of your peer’s posts.\n\nTopic 6\nReply\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n28 May 20:59| Last reply 30 May 9:07\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nDiversifying Income and Building Sustainability in the Third Sector\nThe growth of third sector and charitable organisations such as food banks during COVID-19 and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis reflects a deep and increasing need for community-based support systems. However, their heavy reliance on short-term, output-focused government funding undermines long-term impact and sustainability. From both research and experience, there are several ways in which these organisations can become more financially resilient, agile, and influential in policymaking:\n1. Diversifying Income Streams\nTo reduce reliance on time-limited public grants, third sector organisations can:\nDevelop social enterprises: Many charities are setting up business arms that offer goods or services while reinvesting profits into their core mission. For example, The Trussell Trust has partnered with retailers and tech firms to run donation-linked campaigns.\nCorporate partnerships: Strategic, values-aligned partnerships with private companies can provide long-term income and resource sharing.\nIndividual giving and legacy donations: Investment in digital fundraising platforms and awareness campaigns has helped some charities significantly grow their donation base.\nReference: NCVO (2023) highlights that charities with diverse income sources were more financially stable during the pandemic.\n(Source: National Council for Voluntary Organisations – www.ncvo.org.uk)\n2. Becoming More Agile\nAgility is key in responding to crises. This includes:\nInvesting in digital infrastructure: Enabling remote support services, managing data more effectively, and enhancing communication.\nCollaborative working models: Pooling resources with other third sector groups or local authorities to avoid duplication and increase efficiency.\nUpskilling volunteers and staff: So they can adapt quickly to changing demands and service needs.\n3. Working With Government Policymakers\nThird sector organisations must play a more active role in influencing social policy:\nData-driven advocacy: Charities often hold unique frontline data about poverty, food insecurity, and housing. Sharing this with policymakers can shape better-targeted interventions.\nInclusion in long-term planning: Instead of being seen as emergency responders, charities should be embedded in local and national resilience strategies.\nDemonstrating outcomes: Providing robust evidence of impact, beyond output metrics, helps justify sustained investment and policy support.\nConclusion\nFor the third sector to continue meeting rising community needs, especially during economic hardship, it must move towards income diversification, operational agility, and proactive policy engagement. Only then can it provide sustainable, long-term support to the most vulnerable.\nReference; \nNational Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO, 2023).\nThey provide insights and data on how UK charities managed through COVID-19 and economic uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of income diversification for financial sustainability.\nCitation:\nNCVO.

However, one of the biggest challenges is that many of these organisations rely on short-term or project-based government funding, which often limits their long-term impact and planning.\nTo move forward, I believe third sector organisations must shift their focus towards resilience and long-term capacity-building, rather than just reacting to crises.\nOne way to strengthen their stability is by building community-led income models. This means not only accepting donations but involving local communities in creating solutions — like community cafés, repair shops, or thrift stores — that generate income while serving a social purpose. These types of micro-initiatives empower people locally and reduce dependency on external funding.\nAnother approach is for these organisations to build stronger alliances with local authorities and other nonprofits. Often, many organisations work in the same area but separately. By collaborating more closely and sharing resources like office space, training, or volunteers, they can reduce costs and strengthen service delivery.\nIn terms of policy influence, the third sector should use evidence and data from the people they serve to push for policy change. Many smaller charities don’t realise how valuable their on-the-ground insights are. By submitting reports, joining local policy networks, and attending public consultations, they can make sure the voices of those in crisis are heard at government level.\nFinally, third sector organisations should invest in staff development and digital skills. Many charities still struggle with technology and rely heavily on a small number of staff or volunteers. Training staff in digital tools, fundraising strategy, and public advocacy can make the organisation more confident and effective in any situation.\nReferences\nNCVO. (2022). Civil Society Almanac.

Many people rely on these organisations for basic needs, such as food and shelter. However, one of the biggest challenges they face is sustainability, especially when their funding depends on short-term government projects.\nTo make third sector organisations more sustainable, I believe they should focus on three key areas: diversifying income, working more flexibly, and partnering with government policymakers.\nFirst, to diversify income, charities can go beyond traditional donations and apply models like social enterprise, where they sell goods or services to fund their main goals. Many also benefit from corporate partnerships, local fundraising, grants, and even online subscriptions. For example, some food banks now partner with local grocery stores to collect regular food donations.\nSecond, these organisations should work more agilely. That means using digital tools, responding faster to local needs, and reducing red tape. For example, during the pandemic, many local charities used WhatsApp and Zoom to coordinate services quickly. Using flexible systems also helps them adapt when funding or community needs change suddenly.\nFinally, it is essential that third sector organisations have a voice in public policy. Instead of just reacting to crises, they should be part of the conversation when new social policies are being created. This can be done through research, case studies, or involving people with lived experience in meetings with government officials. Building these relationships can lead to long-term solutions, not just emergency aid.\nIf third sector organisations can build more reliable income, adapt faster, and be part of shaping policy, they will not only survive but grow stronger in the long run.\nReferences\nMacmillan, R.

Most of these organisations depend on brief projects for funding which sometimes prevents them from having a lasting effect. As a result, organizations in the third sector should increase their funding, adapt work practices and regularly engage with policy experts. A good way to increase income is to blend public money, social business, campaigns for raising funds, partnering with companies and digital giving. Crowdfunding and teaming up with supermarkets have been key to The Trussell Trust in supporting their food banks for years (The Trussell Trust, 2021). Thanks to digitalisation, charities can serve more people and raise more money. It is also very important to be agile. Hence, governmental processes should be updated by replacing strict structures with agile systems that emphasise making decisions fast, more use of technology and greater service closeness to citizens (Macmillan, 2020). The use of agile strategies helps third sector organisations respond quickly to the changing needs of their communities. Partnership with government officials helps achieve significant changes in a business. Together with service users, some organisations now work with policymakers to design new solutions to poverty and exclusion (Clark et al., 2022).\nAll in all, sustainability for the third sector over the long term is achieved when organisations have varied incomes, can adapt to changes and influence public policy through working jointly.\nSources\nClark, J., Kane, D., Wilding, K. & Bass, P.

Diversity\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.1 The business case for Diversity\n\nMaking a business case for diversity has provided justification to organisations for best practices and how it can drive progress and improve companies bottom line.  The links between diversity and financial improvement has strengthened over the last few years and organisations that have incorporated “social listening” of their employee online reviews shows the importance of inclusion and why companies should pay attention to diversity on moral grounds of fairness and equal opportunity.  However the report from Orgiane Georgea and Aneeta Rattan in June 2022, outlined why organisations should stop making the business case for diversity as they found that this approach makes underrepresented job candidates less interested to work with an organisation and it undermines Diversity and Inclusion effort.  The authors suggested that a ”fairness” case is more effective and is based on “moral grounds”.  Through their research they found that 80% of organisations used the business case to justify diversity with less than 5% using the fairness case.  They also found that:\n“Our statistically robust findings show that underrepresented participants who read a business case for diversity on average anticipated feeling 11% less sense of belonging to the company, were 16% more concerned that they would be stereotyped at the company, and were 10% more concerned that the company would view them as interchangeable with other members of their identity group, compared to those who read a fairness case.”\nUltimately the business case for diversity can have negative impacts on underrepresented groups as it can undermine diversity efforts and therefore a fairness case is more effective. \n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\nv7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.2 Diversity and Inclusion at Work\n\nReports have identified that Women and BAME communities are under-represented in full-time work and leadership roles across UK organisations who need to explore wider talent pools to draw candidates from throughout the community and understanding diverse markets and clients.  One example in 2020 was Marks and Spencer who reviewed its workforce and identified that it needed to reflect a truly diverse and inclusive environment through its employment practices, its retailing practices including ranges it carries and its store layouts and as a business with stores in the communities.  Marks and Spencer had a large population of retail assistants who were white females and they identified that they needed to more reflective to represent their diverse customer base through recruiting, retaining diverse talent through setting targets for ethnic minorities and women in management.\nAnother initiative across organisations has been to increase the number of women into executive roles at Board level.  During 2021 40% of UK FTSE 100 board positions were held by women compared with 12.5% just over 10 years ago.  (Gov.uk, 2022).  Having a diverse workforce can generate higher profits and even a 10% increase in women in organisation has been linked to 3% in increase in profits.\nThe government has introduced legislation in the form of Gender pay Gap reporting for organisations with over 250 employees who have to report annually on their gender pay gap with the aim of helping reduce the gap between what women and men are paid.  Some organisations have set targets to reduce this imbalance with a large construction company setting targets to increase the number of women they employ to earning over £40,000 a year to at least 25% by 2025.  Visit the equality and human rights act and read the Closing the Gender Pay Gap report. \nTraditionally the typical family model has been the women as care giver providing care for the children and being employed in part-time roles, allowing them to work around childcare for example with the man being the breadwinner going out to work.  Many leaders in organisations have been white strong men.  Thinking about governments we have seen only one black leader in the USA and two women prime ministers in the UK, which does not represent our diverse communities.\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n7.3 So what are the solutions?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.3 So what are the solutions?\n\nOne of the solutions is to introduce Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging Programmes.  Organisations such as the UK Supreme Court have created diversity, inclusion and belonging strategies to help them reflect the society we live in and to respect the differences and supporting equal opportunity for everyone.  This means doing the right thing and that every member of staff within the court feels they belong through contributing their views which will be valued.   \nYou can read more about their strategy as - https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/uksc-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-strategy-2021.pdfLinks to an external site. \nSome of the ways that organisations can introduce these programmes is to ensure that they attract, recruit and develop diverse talent and work with under-represented groups to retain diverse workforce.  Development of inclusive leaders is important, and organisations need to ensure these have the skills, confidence and behaviours to build positive relations that enables all employees to thrive.  Through people analytics and data collection relating to diversity will help understand and develop aspects of diversity in the workplace.  By being an employer of choice and taking action to be inclusive, supportive and respectful will ensure that employees wellbeing matters and it is a brilliant experience for all.  Finally organisations that support accessibility for all in promoting education and outreach work will promote themselves to others. \n\nTopic 7\n7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.4 Procedural OR Restorative Actions\n\nEqual opportunities legislation is generally targeted at ensuring procedural justice is promoted and it prohibits discrimination against ANYONE.  However Affirmative Action programmes on the other hand, deliberately attempt to advance groups under-represented in the workforce through redistributive, or retributive justice.\nOrganisations need to ensure that they have fair:\nRecruitment policies\njob criteria\nTraining programmes for discriminated groups\npromotion procedures to senior positions for discriminated groups\nDiscrimination as the solution to discrimination?  Positive discrimination is generally unlawful in the UK for example where an employer wants to recruit a person specifically based on their protected characteristics such as Race for example.  However the previous Met Police Chief Cressida Dick asked for the law to be changed so that their recruitment processes could favour ethnic minority candidates over white applications as currently the force does not represent the community and nearly 8000 complaints of racism have been received.  The Met Police want to recruit a diverse workforce that represents their community; however this may mean they are not selecting the best candidates and having  targets to recruit higher ethnic participation is good may mean accepting lower standards.\n\nTopic 7\n7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 7 – Wellbeing > 7.5 Challenging Ideas of Wellbeing at Work/About Work \n\nIndividuals are living longer than previously with life expectancy for example in the UK which has increased from about 72 in the 1960s to 81.2 years in 2019.  This means that individuals are likely to work longer and therefore organisations need to review the opportunities for the older generation.  Thinking about some job roles, how realistic that someone in their 70s can be an active firefighter or prison warden?  Therefore organisations need to think about different job roles and how individuals can manage their work and expectancy.  Individuals will be less likely to be able to retire at 65 as they may not have the required savings to provide a reasonable income and research has suggested that many individuals currently in their mid-40s may need to work into their early to mid-70s to cover this financial shortfall. \nThis image from Gratton and Scott (2017) study shows some of the changes for example historically individuals went to school, work and then retired.  However now they have multistages of life, they go to school they may work as an employee, or they may look to mix this with self-employment or even have a portfolio of work which is paid and unpaid which they may take into retirement.  Therefore organisations need to consider how they can change corporate policies and HR policies and practices to support healthy and prosperous longevity.\n\nFigure 1:  Changing Ideas of Wellbeing at/about Work (Gratton & Scott, 2017)\nThe world has changed and how we are introduced to different “generations” in society.  Generations is the sociological notion of being born across a span of about 20 years, for example:\nGen Z (zoomers) born mid to late 1990s to early 2010\nGen Y (millennials) born between 1981 and 1994/6\nGen X born between 1965 and 1981\nBaby boomers born between 1945 and 1964\nThe literature is clear, the statistical differences across most measures on common work issues/styles is so small that more research should be focusing on generational similarities and not differences.   Each of these different generations may exist at the same time and therefore how do organisations build gaps between the way they work and communicate?   Gen X tend to have values of ambition and strong ability to work hard where Gen Y are competitive in an extremely advanced world.  Gen Z grew up with tablets and smartphones and digital experiences are crucial to their DNA.  They are able to multi-task be independent and can be demanding in the workplace and if they are not engaged, they will leave.\nSo what can an employer do to improve its working practices covering these generational differences? \nEmployers need to develop wellbeing policies and procedures to ensure that employees are engaged and thrive through reduced stress, anger and health problems.  The relationship between engagement and wellbeing is vital because when people experience work influences their lives outside work and overall wellbeing influence their lives at work.\nGallup have produced a report which identified that wellbeing is crucial for business.  You can read it here:  https://www.gallup.com/workplace/313067/employees-aren-thriving-business-struggling.aspxLinks to an external site.. \nThe report was based on positive psychology, and it identified 34 themes based on the fact that the individual spends approximately 81,396 hours at work.  Organisations now report their employee engagement to customers, and they suggested that those not thriving in their lives are more vulnerable and add risk to the organisation in terms of burnout and stress.   They also identified that 52% of workers who were thriving had less missed absence and struggling employees had higher levels of depression and anxiety resulting in big differences in productivity.  The latest 2022 report identified that global engagement was still low and employee stress was at a new all-time high with over 44% of employees experiencing daily stress.  The report also identified that the best places in the world to be an employee were the US And Candidate with being the No1s for living comfortably, employee engagement, job opportunities and second for wellbeing.\nHow can organisations improve wellbeing?\nPerkbox in 2020, identified the following different ways that an organisation can improve employee wellbeing:\nProvide employee assistance programme\nHelp employees work towards long-term goals\nSet friendly fitness challenges\nIntroduce wellbeing-based employee benefits\nArrange regular get-togethers\nIntroduce designated wellbeing leaders\nEncourage real breaks\nCreate a comfortable work environment\nReward and recognise great work\nEncourage staff to take responsibility for their own wellbeing\nConsider offering unlimited holidays\nCreate stronger employee-manager relationships\nArrange wellbeing workshops\nMake it easy for your staff to make healthy choices\nTweak the working routine to work for staff\nSurvey teams to find out which of the wellbeing initiatives are working\nThinking about our own organisation which of these initiatives do they offer and how effective do you think they are?\n\nTopic 7\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762188-20564-Topic_8_.docx ---\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. The business of business is business’.\n‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’.\n\nHowever, only human beings have moral responsibility for their actions; corporations aren’t human beings, despite the name and the sense of being a body.  Doing otherwise than acting for shareholders was for him a betrayal and theft from shareholders’ dividends.\nTherefore, as long as business complies with society’s laws and regulations for business, their only responsibility is to act in the best interest of shareholders and businesses aren’t elected, and managers aren’t trained to decide what’s in society’s best interests.\nFriedman was part of the Chicago School of Economics, associated with monetarist policy, reduction in public spending. Arguably, with his ideological opponent JM Keynes, the most influential economist of the 20th century.  This article is ‘The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits’ and if you look on Canvas you can read it in full.  It was an essay published over 50 years ago in (1970) and took issue with what he saw as a distressing trend among corporations to worry about social responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.1 Some Definitions\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.1 Some Definitions\n\nWhat is a corporation?  A corporation or company is defined in terms of its legal status and the ownership of assets.  Corporate is an American word which is the same word we use company for UK businesses.  Corporations are typically regarded as “artificial persons” in the eyes of the law, and they are notionally owned by shareholders, although they exist independently of them.  Managers and directors have a “fiduciary” responsibility to protect the investment of shareholders (Crane and Matten, 2016). \n\nMilton Friedman in (1970) suggested that:\n‘The social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.

responsibility.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.2 Corporate Social Responsibility\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.2 Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCSR has become the widely accepted term for when companies have a “corporate internal decision structure which directs decisions in line with predetermined goals” – strategy (French 1979) and that organisations “manifest a set of beliefs and values that lay out what is generally regarded as right or wrong in the corporation”  organizational culture (Moore 1999).  There is a sense that they are entities which can have a social impact, and that therefore this should be positive as far as possible and hence CSR is a worldwide phenomenon, above all though in the US.\n‘Semantics aside, if corporations are to formulate and implement strategies in turbulent environments, theories of strategy must have concepts, such as the wide sense of stakeholder, which allows the analysis of all external forces and pressures whether they are friendly or hostile.’  Edward Freeman (1984)\n“Corporate social responsibility is concerned with the ways in which an organization exceeds the minimum obligations to stakeholders specified through regulation and corporate governance” (Johnson and Scholes, 2002, p. 247)\nIn 2008, Banerjee put forward the moral and logical case for CSR in that:\nCorporations are powerful social actors that cause social problems and produce social goods\nCorporations should think beyond making money\nCorporations should behave in an ethical manner\nCorporations should be involved with the community they operate within\nThey can not escape their responsibilities and they must pay attention to social and environmental issues.  Organisations must demonstrate a high level of integrity and transparency across their organisations and use sustainable resources for the greater good.  They should also enhance social welfare for providing community support through philanthropy and other means. \nCarroll’s CSR pyramid is a framework for explaining how and why organisations should take social responsibility and highlights four of the most important types of responsibility for organisation:\nEconomic responsibility\nLegal responsibility\nEthical responsibility\nPhilanthropic responsibility\n\nFigure 1:  Carroll’s CSR Pyramid (ResearchGate, 2022).\nEconomic responsibility is the foundation of the pyramid and structure and is fundamental to survive in business and profitability and compliance with the law are important for social responsibility through producing goods and services that society needs at a fair price with employees who do their jobs safely and fairly.\nLegal responsibility relates to compliance with the law such as minimum wage for example across both national and local regulations.  It also regulates behaving as company citizens, meeting legal obligations through supplying goods and services that meet minimum legal requirements.\nEthical responsibility relates to embracing activities in an ethical manner and consistent with society’s expectations and respecting evolving and ethical standards that are adopted by society.  It also reflects preventing infringement of ethical standards and acknowledging that business integrity and ethical behaviour go beyond compliance with laws and regulations. \nPhilanthropic responsibility relates to voluntary and discretionary activities and practices of business such as giving back to the community through volunteer work.\nIn 1991, Donna Wood identified different approaches to Corporate Social Performance in terms of:\nHaving social policies - explicit statements of company values, goals; and social targets; emission / recycling targets.\nLeading to social programs - Activities and instruments to measure achievements of social policies.\nWith measurable social impacts - Concrete changes the corporation has achieved towards its CSR policies; although it can be difficult to measure – ‘soft’, qualitative data\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/258977.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab2fdd8176c1e350c1c53247f5931f875Links to an external site.\nWe have seen in earlier lessons how the UN is supporting global change.  Through the Global Compact campaign the UN has enacted 10 ethical principles for long – term success.  The image below shows the 10 different principles:\n\nFigure 2:  UN 10 Ethical Principles - https://www.atlantica.com/web/en/sustainability/united-nations-global-compact-ungc/Links to an external site.\nThese principles are not legally binding or mandatory or enforced but reflect the way they should be working.  It has been suggested that the Global Compact is “bluewashing” which refers to the fact that few companies are actually complying with these principles.    Bluewashing is bad because consumers tend to think that companies are more ethical and socially responsible than they are as they use their membership of Global Compact as an easy way out.  Bluewashing is focussing on human rights and labour conditions and where companies are required to submit reports.  Between 2005-2013 many thousands of companies did not comply.  Companies have said they prefer voluntary codes of conduct.\nIn addition to Bluewashing there is “greenwashing”.   This means, a strategy where companies over-emphasise positive aspects of their environmental records to mask their actual performance’ (Marquis & Qian, 2013). “At the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, a group of NGOs held a Greenwash Academy Awards event to criticize companies that falsely promote themselves as environmentally responsible and to “recognize these companies for what they are: hypocrites.” (Lyon and Maxwell, 2006, p.4) \nHere are some examples of Greenwashing in action:\n‘BP Going Green’ and ‘Beyond Petroleum’…\nThis was a multi-million-dollar advertising campaigns where they were promoting commitment to alternative energy sources.\n‘Shifting from oil to energy companies’ and they suggested ‘From the Earth to the Sun, and everything in between’ and were awarded ‘Golden Paintbrush’ by Greenpeace in 2008\nGlobal Financial Crisis where BP shut its alternative energy HQ and Shell stopped investing in wind / solar.\nSince then there has been some progress due to shareholder pressures.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.3 CSR Choices: Shareholders and Stakeholders \nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.3 CSR Choices: Shareholders and Stakeholders \n\nCorporate social responsibility depends on whether ethical behaviour is rewarded, and/or unethical behaviour is punished or the legitimacy of the stakeholders’ claims.  This means that the leaders’ values are important, and pressures are placed on leaders to act ethically and not unethically.   For example, when stakeholders needs and goals clash, then the most powerful tend to win.\nThis is problematic because CSR a ‘northern’ / developed world phenomenon and  the ‘Ideas developed in New York, not Sao Paolo’.  This means that power and influence of customers  in developed countries is greater than workers in developing countries and the interests of customers in developed countries are  different to interests of workers in developing countries,  CSR programs directives of ‘west’ and companies’ choses CSR goals, employees have to follow. \n\nFigure 3:  Stakeholder Map\nIf there is conflict is there a business case for CSR?  Can organisations really show causation between CSR and profits?  Good corporate citizenship can be related to good financial performance in terms of brand reputation and be attractive to prospective and current employees and we have seen earlier poor examples such as Primark where poor practice impacted their brand.   \nThe image below shows how the firms’ actions and financial returns influence primary stakeholders and society:\n\nFigure 4:  Mapping the business cases\nThe dotted line at the lowest part of the image shows how a firms actions link directly to financial returns and therefore shareholders take actions to remain viable.  The positive signs show how stakeholder theory reflects on firms’ financial returns which are enhanced through actions that improve the relationship with its primary stakeholder.   The dashed line at the top represents the complicated link between firms’ actions and financial returns with society.   Therefore the better the firms’ actions to better society but does it impact financial viability? \nThis article explains this in more detail and gives some good examples as to the conflict between society and stakeholders - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0007650316660044Links to an external site.  The business Case for CSR:  A critique and an indirect path forward, Barnett, 2016.\nIt could be argued that the freedom to engage in entrepreneurial activities is in itself socially responsible and can bring many benefits to society including jobs, training and revenue for suppliers.  We have seen poor practices from companies where they have dumped waste into the oceans, or their production processes pollute the air.  Apart from affecting the local community this could also impact the employees and put them at risk, increasing absence, reducing productivity and may result in fines which will negatively impact the profits and therefore the shareholders.   In 2018, a study by McKinsey found that the top quartile of companies which promoted ethnic and cultural diversity within their executive teams were 33% more likely to lead profitable companies.  Shareholders expect return on investment and companies are looking at ways they can support the communities through offering training to young people who might not have the best education and although there are costs to the shareholders of this, in the longer term the trainees become more productive and profits increase.\nSuccessful CSR\nLego if an example of great practices when it comes to CSR and sustainability.  Lego is renowned for being one of the most reputable companies in the world and not just through helping children develop through creative play but through fostering a healthier planet.  The World Wildlife Fund Climate Savers Partners named Lego in terms of its pledge to reduce its carbon footprint.  The only toy company to be named. \nBy 2030 Lego plans to use only environmentally friendly materials to produce its core products and packaging and one way that is has done this was through shrinking the box sizes by 14% in 2013 and 2014, saving approximately 7000 tons of cardboard.  They moved away from producing the blocks using petroleum-based plastic and has committed to remove all single use plastic packing from its materials by 2025. \nIn addition it has invested $164 million into a sustainable materials centre where researchers are experimenting with different bio-based materials which Lego can implement into the production process.  This is a really good example of how businesses can be socially responsible but also result in increased the profits which almost doubled between 2012 and 2015 and have increased by mover 5 million dollars between 2016 and 2021.\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.4 The End of CSR?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 8 – Corporate Social Responsibility > 8.4 The End of CSR?\n\nIn 2012 Peter Fleming wrote about the ‘end of corporate social responsibility’ and he argued that most CSR-related activity was motivated by profit, not principles and CSR was an ideological practice that extended exploitative and colonising agenda of the corporation.\nThe article identified that damage inflicted by global firms is systematic rather than piecemeal.  They also identified gigatrends which are likely to affect the future of humanity such climate change, energy depletion, rise of BRIC nations, the genome revolution and over-population of megactivities located in the southern hemisphere. \nFleming and Jones have argued that actually large corporations tend to act only in the interests of a small number of stakeholders (e.g., their senior managers and equity holders) and therefore lack the ability to deliver outcomes that are beneficial to society as a whole.    Therefore, it could be argued that actually CSR is not about reducing the business effects on society but more a public relations strategy designed to convince governments and employees that they can still do good and make money at the same time.  Brennan argued that CSR is a “parasite” (Brennan, on wider social movements and was really more about the response to damage caused by global corporations.  Large corporates in the past have exploited workers in developing countries and are now exploiting the situation they have caused to the economic advantage to their most powerful stakeholders.  \nCompanies such as Allbirds or Sweetgreen are companies that are building social responsibility as a cornerstone to their business rather than companies that are trying to effectuate the change.  The public today is holding business leaders to account and trust in government is in decline across the UK and USA in particular.  Millennials and Gen-Z are driving this change and exert influences on organisations through purchasing power. \nIs CSR just propaganda designed to cover up parasitic corporate behaviour?\n\nTopic 8\nPrevious\nNext\n8.5 Activity 1 – Sustainability and Responsible Business

Sustainability is about using resources wisely so that we don’t harm the planet and can continue to live well in the future.\nMain Global and Business Issues:\nClimate change – causing floods, droughts, and extreme weather that affect farming, homes, and businesses.\nPollution – from factories, cars, and plastic waste, harming air, water, animals, and human health.\nOveruse of natural resources – such as oil, water, and forests, leading to shortages and high costs.\nInequality – some businesses pay low wages or use child labor, which creates poverty.\nWaste management – businesses producing too much waste that ends up in landfills or oceans.\nHow These Issues Started Over Time:\nIn the past, businesses focused only on profit and growth, with little care for th\n\n\n--- File: 1749098807_6841213762296-20564-topic_9_.docx ---\n9.1 Social enterprise and entrepreneurs?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.1 Social enterprise & entrepreneurs?\n\nA social enterprise is an independent business which is autonomous of the state and government control and set up to help the severely disadvantaged.  For example Jamie Oliver created “fifteen” which is the name of restaurants founded by the Chef to create employment for the severely disadvantaged.\nSocial entrepreneurs are those that work to improve social issues through business whilst generating profit for shareholders.  For example, Bill Drayton is a social entrepreneur and founded Ashoka:  Innovators for the Public in 1980 which looks to find and support social entrepreneurs globally.  He set out to alter existing patterns of activity and vetting and electing social entrepreneurs with unique qualities. \nLatest figures suggest there are over 100K social enterprises in the UK and they have been set up to deal with major problems such as helping overcome child poverty, drop in wages, rising house prices, pollution levels across 40 towns and cities in the UK along with obesity. \nSocial enterprises have flourished due to the failure of existing institutions to solve them through welfare state which was designed to support full, full-time employment or through bureaucracy in terms of slow, costly and dehumanising processes.  Therefore there was a need for a new approach to solving these problems.    Social enterprises get their income mainly from trading in goods and services from fast-moving, evolving environment in comparison to charities that get their income from grants and donations and existing in a more stable and slow moving environment.,    However there are some grey areas in terms of charities as social enterprises.\nThey have characteristics that enable them to transform systems and practices through being innovative, market orientated and driven to system change.  They are good at setting a mission and strong communicators being able to tell the story that focuses on the social good of the product.  They are also visionary and alliance builders and can communicate their aims in moral terms and happy to take help from wherever they can.\nSo where does social enterprise fit it?  Have a look at this image from Clearly So, 2015.\n\nFigure 1:  Where does social enterprise fit?\n\nSocial enterprises operate using different types of business model:\nFee for Service Model:\n\nFigure 2:  Fee for Service model\nIn this model the beneficiary pays for the services for a fee eg Fair for You which is a lender offering an alternative to loan sharks.  The income comes from the interest people pay directly in exchange for the service.  Legally, a charity is the sole owner of the lending company, which can gift profits to the charity.\n\nSubsidization Model:\n\nFigure 3:  Subsidization Model\nHere, the beneficiaries get stuff cheaper or free, and consumers pay for the benefits.  For example TOMS – sells shoes. For each pair sold, another is given to someone in need.  Does a lot more too…\nOf course it may be that the trading just pays for a service to be given away, not just identical products.\n\nEmployment (Social Firm Model):\n\nFigure 4:  Employment (Social Firm Model)\nSocial firms aim to employ people from disadvantaged groups.  They trade to consumers, but people in them get work, dignity, self-respect, or training.  Harry Specters’ mission is to ‘offer confidence and hope to young people with autism by providing employment and free training, enabling them to produce great products, such as our award-winning chocolates. In doing so, we aim to be a role model for “great product, great cause” for other businesses, individuals and entrepreneurs.’\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\nv9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.2 Social Enterprise Goals\n\nSome of the social enterprise goals are driven by not profit or shareholder value but through setting their own high standards.  Social enterprises have missions to support and serve social or ethical issues and needs through directly being involved in the production of services.  Social enterprises create jobs and operate by setting a standard of ethics to service the society and one of the key differences is that social enterprises are less concerned with paying owners and stakeholders but more concerned with serving their societal mission.\n\nHere are some examples of social enterprise goals:\n‘Getting something from nothing’ through un-/Under-used physical, social, financial capital or through putting them to use satisfying some unmet social need(s); and by delivering outputs more efficiently than public or private sectors.\nForming long-term relationships that develop over time by outlining how it is Not about providing a service to clients nor is it about short-term profit; but it is about Long-term social return and Inclusivity by creating a sense of membership / belonging and recognising unique, distinct / different needs of users.\nInnovation and creativity:  through design / deliver new approaches to pressing problems and combine approaches from public and private sector bodies and experimenting the ‘R&D wing of the welfare system’ by creating a portfolio of solutions to issues.\nBeing ethical in terms of Britain’s top 5 co-operatives pay more tax than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Ebay and Starbucks; Pay fair wages to 2,000,000 employees; and Do the greatest good possible: 28% of Social Enterprises work in poorest communities (only 12% of SMEs)\nBe successful with more social enterprises generated a profit last year than private, Growth rate of ‘responsible’ brands nearly double that of ‘conventional’ brands; Judged as ‘fairer, more diverse, and serve customers to a higher standard’ than public / private.  Demonstrate their social impact to stakeholders which is Difficult, not impossible.\nHowever Social Enterprises have started working with large corporations to drive impact together.  Through COVID-19 and climate change the private sector has been transformed and has provided corporate leaders with the opportunity to focus on their social responsibilities.  An example of this is when COVID-19 hit and a group of 85 foundations, corporations and intermediaries came together to create the World Economic Forum’s COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs.  Through social procurement strategies the group was able to provide mutually beneficial outcomes for corporations and social enterprises.   Large organisations such as Ikea and Unilever were already adopters of souring from social enterprises and with the support of Ikea Social Entrepreneurship has published the first corporate report on social enterprises.   You can read more about this report here:  How Corporations and Social Enterprises do business together to drive impact – Available at: Acumen | Corporate ReadyLinks to an external site.\nOn of the key changes to employment practices, driven by COVID-19 has been the gig-economy.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.3 Uberization or the Gig Economy\n\nYou were introduced to Uber and the Gig Economy in an earlier lesson but here we will develop this further in terms of how it is changing the world of work.  Uberization has been defined as “fragmented work” where workers are offered small individual pieces of work which the worker can choose to accept or not.  Typically this is offered through apps that is used by both consumers and workers as an interface with little or no intermediatory.  This can have advantages for the worker in that it provides flexibility, greater independence, variety of work and pay.  However there are also disadvantages in the fact that they are not paid benefits such as sick pay, maternity leave or career progression and sometimes find it difficult to switch off. \nFrom a business perspective there are advantages as it lowers costs and gives them flexibility to adapt to scale as workers are not locked into contracts and therefore there is less regulation.  However there are usually high turnover of workers who tend to be less qualified or reliable workers and can lead to poor public perception of the organisation.\nHowever those working in Crowd working can be through global platforms who are looking for highly skilled workers:\n\nFigure 5:  Crowd working and Gig Work\nCrowd employment is a new form of employment that still uses online platform to enable organisations or individuals to solve problems or provide services in exchange for payment eg outsourcing of tasks to pool of online workers rather than single employee.  The work is based on individual tasks rather than continuous work.  Crowd working has been replaced with the term “platform work”.\nThe platform economy has brought benefits in creating jobs but for the individual it usually means they end up working for more than one platform for poor pay resulting in poor working conditions and being unable to financially survive.    Gig work is growing at a rapid rate with the sector more than doubling in size since 2016 with more than 7.25 million workers in the UK in 2022.  Part of this is due to technology and apps to sell their labour but also Covid-19 has had a massive impact in terms of how we work.    Platform economy is eg UberEats or Glovo for example and offers workers per gig basis.  A gig worker sells their skills through a platform and are usually locally based. \nPlatform work is remote and is mainly through providing digital services such as data entry or programming on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr which acts as an auction house for human labour, where individuals bid for work.  Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in lower-wage countries and it has been suggested that the office faces a future like that of the factory floor where work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. \nSadly those that work in the gig economy are no longer protected by a legal system that was designed for a different age as they are defined by workers.  Workers have minimum wage and trade union rights protected as well as paid holiday entitlements.  Only “employees” are entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payment, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal.  Gig-economy firms assume their workers to be self-employed and fight trade union such as the Independent Workers’ Union  of GB who claim otherwise.\nIt is estimated that the number of gig workers is constantly on the increase and the figure employed in this type of work is anticipated to surpass 90 million by 2028.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to keep gig workers as part of their future workforce.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.4 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\n\nOne of the other factors influencing the changing world of work is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and how they will impact the creation of new jobs.  The image below shows how these are interrelated:\n\nFigure 6:  AI or Machine Learning (Coinsight.com)\nArtificial intelligence is a computer-based design system to think the way human intelligence does and means more than doing specific tasks like Alexa who responds to your voice.  AI has the ability to make decisions and it learns from data science to create something new.  It has been used to tackle problems such as testing drug compounds for curing cancer.   AI can be used to monitor customer tracking on websites or changing traffic patterns.  Amazon Go uses AI algorithms to create unmanned convenience stores that monitor your shopping experience and charge you automatically when you walk out the door.  For example up to 400 cameras in the store monitor your interactions to charge you appropriately. \nIn contrast machine and deep learning are algorithms which do one task really well eg analysing data over time and therefore are only as good as the data flowing through the system.  Alexa runs machine learning software where the price goes up or down based on your personal information, the email that gets filtered to your inbox or chat boxes that respond when you ask questions.\nCompanies are using deep learning models and AI to stay competitive through using behavioural biometrics or language processes to improve customer service and IT management.  Therefore, data scientists and machine learning engineers are in high demand and managers and organisation need to “manage” these AI processes similarly to how they would manage people as they are a resource.  This can also include “robots” and “robotics” which means development of a new set of skills in the workplace.  AI and machine learning are going to change the way we work but they are not likely to make human workers obsolete for an awfully long time.  Automated tasks are likely to be replaced by AI but it will also drive innovation to create many new sectors for growth resulting in more wider job creation. \nHowever a recent TUC report on AI has identified the ways that AI could lead to discrimination and is calling for urgent legal reform in this area.  One recent example is how Linkedin for example has been pushing “cleaning” adverts to women only.   The case of UberLyft in the Dutch courts held the dismissal by machine as unlawful and how under GDPR automated decision making is prohibited.  The TUC have asked for an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide a right not to be discriminated against or subject to detriment for the processing of inaccurate data or through making all those in the \"value chain” jointly liable for discriminatory AI.\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.5 Modern Slavery\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.5 Modern Slavery\n\nDue to the expansion of globalization, one of the outcomes of this has resulted in modern slavery where people are forced to work through threat, or they become owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical abuse, they become dehumanized through being treated as a resource, their freedom is restrained or they are exploited through underpayment (Crane, 2013b).\nRead through the Ethics in Act 7.2 from the text book and reflect on how modern slavery is impacting employees at work.\n\n\nTopic 9\nPrevious\nNext\n9.6 The Employment Relationship\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 9 Social Enterprise, Gig Economy, AI & Future of Work > 9.6 The Employment Relationship\n\nEmployees are managed by the HR department and the term Human Resource Management has subject to debate as it implies humans are the resource and usually the most costly resource within an organisation.  Employees have various rights at work such as to respect their employer which is based on a general understanding of human rights and employment law.  The employee also has duties in terms of completing the work based on their contract within wider employment laws.   For example, an employee has the right to freedom from discrimination or to privacy or to health and safety working conditions.  They have duties to comply with their contract, with the law and respect the employers property.   Many organisations have comprehensive diversity, equality and inclusion policies to promote best working practices and engage staff across the organisation.  We have seen earlier sections of this course examples from Marks and Spencer and the MET police in the UK and how they are trying to attract a more diverse workforce.  We have also looked at women in senior posts and gender pay gap reporting and this is still a problem with discrimination practices being demonstrated through the recruitment and selection process and even recent cases such as Asda have highlighted the differences in pay between women and men carrying out like work.\nEmployees are entitled to privacy and control the information about themselves.  \nThere are four types of privacy:\nPhysical – surveillance cameras in private rest areas would compromise physical privacy\nSocial – freedom to behave in our private life as we so choose – however if it brings the organisation into “disrepute” then actions could be taken\nInformational – how, when and to what extent private data about others can be released and breaches eg employees social media can be monitored by organisations if it brings the organisation into disrepute\nPsychological – controlling emotional outburst and not being forced to share private thoughts and feels eg making employees smile and appear happy in front of customers.\nDepending on the organisation and industry, some employers carry out routine health and drug testing of their employees and this has been contested as an issue of business ethics.  The problem is that employees feel that the tests are taken too often and take more information than the employer actually needs and therefore does the test do more harm than good? \nTracking of emails has been common for sometime as well as checking what the employee downloads to their PC and has resulted in dismissals where company information has been leaked or when inappropriate materials have been downloaded.\nSurveillance cameras have become significant in recent years and many offices use these to protect employees and employers and there are many examples of where employees have been caught “red” handed when committing crimes or demonstrating inappropriate behaviours across the workplace.  With Covid-19 and hybrid, home working, the use of surveillance has increased and is currently under debate.  Some of the banks have adopted “key board” tracking surveillance so they can tell when their employees are typing, some are accessing the employees webcam to see when they “move” from their seat and it could be argued this is an infringement of privacy and it is interesting to see how this will develop over the next few years and how employment law/cases will introduce controls in this area.\nHow do you think surveillance will develop in the next five years? \nHow do you feel about this level of surveillance in your home when home working and how would handle this if your employer said this was mandatory from the 1st January next year?\nMake some notes and reflect on these ethical areas of change in the workplace.\n\nTopic

challenging the gig economy can be for drivers and other workers. Many of them work under zero-hour or flexible contracts, which give them freedom but don’t offer proper protections like sick pay, holiday pay, or job security. This creates a situation where workers have high risks but fewer rights.\nFor example, in the UK, Uber drivers have gone on strike several times over low pay, poor working conditions, and lack of rights. One important event was the UK Supreme Court ruling that Uber drivers should be treated as workers, not just self-employed, giving them access to basic rights. Also, the deal between Uber and the GMB union was a big step toward improving representation for drivers, allowing them to raise concerns and negotiate better conditions.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nOffer Minimum Protections: Even if workers are on flexible contracts, employers should give basic benefits like minimum wage, sick leave, and holiday pay.\nClear Contracts: Companies should give workers clear information about their rights, responsibilities, and how their pay is calculated.\nAllow Union Support: Like the Uber-GMB deal, gig workers should have access to unions or worker groups to protect their rights and raise their voices.\nUse Technology Fairly: Companies that use apps to manage workers (like Uber) must ensure the systems are fair, transparent, and not exploitative.\nListen to Workers: Regular feedback and communication with workers can help identify problems and improve working conditions.\nConclusion: The gig economy is growing, but companies must find a balance between flexibility and fairness. Giving workers more rights and protections doesn’t just help them—it also improves company reputation and worker satisfaction in the long run.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:08| Last reply 30 May 8:57\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nAfter reading the articles, it’s clear that Uber’s business model has come under a lot of pressure due to how it treats its drivers. The strikes, pay disputes, and legal challenges show that gig workers often face unstable incomes and limited rights. While Uber has made some progress—like its agreement with the GMB union to give 70,000 drivers minimum wage, holiday pay, and pensions—there’s still more to be done.\nIn the gig economy, many workers are classed as self-employed, which means they miss out on basic protections. To change this, employers should move toward offering more secure contracts that include benefits like sick pay, regular working hours, and protection against unfair dismissal. They should also be more open to working with unions, like GMB, and give workers a voice in decision-making. Fair algorithms and transparent policies on pay and work allocation are also key.\nUltimately, gig work can offer flexibility, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of basic rights.

The gig economy has brought a lot of flexibility to workers, but it also comes with big downsides especially when it comes to job security, pay, and basic rights.\nIn the Bloomberg article, we see concerns over a fuel shortage and a possible union strike, which shows just how fragile the situation can be for gig workers. The Employee Benefits article highlights that drivers are striking over pay, showing that many of them don’t feel fairly treated. But there are also signs of progress. The GMB Union deal article shows that 70,000 Uber drivers in the UK now have union representation, which is a huge step forward. And the Supreme Court ruling confirms that Uber drivers are workers not independent contractors which means they’re entitled to benefits like minimum wage and holiday pay.\nThese developments show that employers can make changes when there’s enough pressure from workers, the public, or legal systems.\nTo improve the situation, companies in the gig economy should:\n•Offer clearer contracts that reflect the reality of the work and provide fair terms.\n•Guarantee a minimum wage, so workers know they’ll earn enough to live on.\n•Provide benefits like sick pay, holiday pay, and pension contributions.\n•Allow union representation so workers have a voice.\n•Be transparent about how pay is calculated and how decisions are made (like deactivations).\nUltimately, flexibility shouldn’t come at the cost of fairness. Gig economy companies can still be profitable while treating their workers with dignity and respect.\nExpand discussion thread from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al AhbabiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nHatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n23 May 17:36| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nReply from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\nThe case of Uber in the UK highlights the growing debate around how companies in the gig economy treat their workers. While platforms like Uber have created jobs for many, they have also raised concerns about job security, pay fairness, and workers’ rights.\nFrom the articles, one of the biggest turning points was the UK Supreme Court’s decision in 2021 that Uber drivers should be classified as “workers” rather than independent contractors (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This gave them legal rights to minimum wage and holiday pay, which was a big win for gig workers in the UK.\nLater, Uber made a historic agreement with GMB Union, giving about 70,000 drivers in the UK the right to union representation (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). While this was praised by many, the situation remains tense. Uber drivers have continued to strike, arguing that pay levels are still too low and conditions are not fully fair (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.).\nThese events show that legal victories alone are not enough — real change needs to happen in the way gig workers are treated daily.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve Gig Work Conditions:\nRedefine What “Gig Work” Means: Employers should stop hiding behind the label of “self-employed” just to avoid giving benefits. If the company controls working hours, pricing, and performance like Uber does then the worker should have rights just like an employee.\nCreate Fair Pay Standards: Gig companies should provide a clear minimum pay guarantee per hour, including waiting time. Drivers often spend time online without rides, which affects their real earnings.\nGive Gig Workers a Voice: Companies should regularly meet with driver representatives and unions to discuss policies and pay. Uber’s deal with GMB was a strong start, but more engagement is needed to fix ongoing disputes.\nBuild Flexibility with Protection: Flexibility is one reason why people join the gig economy  but it should not come at the cost of basic protections. Employers should offer opt-in insurance, sick pay schemes, and support services.\nInvest in Worker Wellbeing: Companies like Uber depend on their drivers, but often offer little support during crises like fuel shortages or pandemics. Offering fuel discounts, mental health resources, and fair cancellation policies can build trust and reduce worker stress.\nConclusion\nThe Uber case shows that responsibility and flexibility can go together. While the company has taken some steps to support its drivers, the ongoing strikes and dissatisfaction suggest that more honest, fair, and balanced systems are needed. The gig economy will only be sustainable if workers are treated as essential partners not disposable service providers.\nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n23 May 17:34| Last reply 30 May 8:58\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nAfter reading the articles about Uber and its drivers in the UK, it’s clear that the gig economy has created a lot of flexibility — but also many challenges for workers. Drivers often work long hours without stable income, benefits, or job security. The Uber case is a great example of how limited protection through self-employment contracts has raised serious concerns.\nIn the past, Uber classified its drivers as independent contractors. This meant they had no access to minimum wage, holiday pay, sick leave, or pensions. The situation reached a turning point when the UK Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that Uber drivers should be treated as \"workers\", not just self-employed freelancers (ADCU, 2021Links to an external site.). This decision was historic because it forced Uber to rethink its contracts and give drivers more legal protection.\nSince then, Uber signed a union agreement with GMB, giving 70,000 UK drivers access to representation, which was a big step forward (GMB, 2021Links to an external site.). Still, challenges remain. According to recent reports, drivers have gone on strike over pay and working conditions, especially during the UK fuel crisis (Bloomberg, 2021Links to an external site.; Employee Benefits, 2022Links to an external site.). Many feel the changes haven’t gone far enough.\nWhat Employers Can Do to Improve the Gig Economy:\nFair Contracts: Employers like Uber should move away from using zero-hour or purely self-employed contracts for core roles. If workers rely on the job for regular income, they should receive protections like minimum wage and sick leave.\nWorker Representation: Giving gig workers access to independent unions and allowing them to raise issues safely is essential. Uber’s agreement with GMB is a positive example, but more companies need to follow this model.\nTransparent Pay and Conditions: Companies should clearly explain how drivers or gig workers are paid, including how rates are set and what deductions apply. Hidden fees and unclear commissions create stress and reduce trust.\nSupport for Health and Wellbeing: Gig workers often work long hours with few breaks. Employers can offer support like insurance, access to counselling, or even discounts on fuel and maintenance.\nTechnology Transparency: Many drivers rely on apps to get work, but these systems often control how much they earn or whether they stay on the platform. Workers should have more input into how these systems work and appeal unfair deactivations.\nConclusion:\nThe Uber case shows that change is possible when workers stand up and the law supports them. But more still needs to be done to make the gig economy fair and sustainable. Employers need to take responsibility — not just for profits, but for the people who power their platforms.\nReferences\nADCU. (2021). Supreme Court Landmark Victory Over Uber.

The clashes Uber has faced in the UK highlight the rising disagreements between new technology and workers’ legal rights. By calling Uber drivers employees, the 2021 decision by the UK Supreme Court redefined what employers must and should provide (Supreme Court, 2021). Employers have many solutions they can implement. Formulating rules that protect the hours worked, benefits received and end of employment can give workers a foundation of dignity in the workplace (ILO, 2021). Let’s also ensure that both workers and management work together for solutions. Whilst that agreement shows progress, Uber should now let drivers contribute to pay discussions and work environment (GMB, 2022). Also, websites must work on becoming more transparent. It is important that everyone can review the algorithms that distribute jobs and salaries, to prevent being exploited. In addition, governments and businesses should together establish rules that list platform workers in different categories with suitable perks. The most ethical approach is for people to have the flexibility they want while still earning fair wages. Following this, companies should rewrite their contracts, help workers unify and put people’s wellbeing first.\nReferences\nGMB. (2022). Uber and GMB Strike Historic Deal.

Pandemic > 10.2 Ethical procurement or corporate gravy train?\n\nYou were introduced to lobbying and the giving of contracts during COVID-19 in an early lesson, however during the pandemic the UK government spent £56m on private consultants during the pandemic, at rates of up to £14,000 per day, without giving other companies a chance to compete. \nSixteen private consultancy firms, including major companies like Deloitte, PWC, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey have been working at the heart of the government’s response to the virus and it is suggested that they have made deals with Tory party donors/members worth up to £526 m: P14 Medical; Meller Designs; Globus (Shetland)  They have been rapidly hired to work on the track and trace system, the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the search to produce working ventilators.\nAmong the contracts given to McKinsey, whose consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks’ work – £14,000 a day - to createLinks to an external site. a permanent replacement for Public Health England, helping define its “vision, purpose and narrative”.\nThere is discussion of a close relationship which centred around horse racing between Dido Harding and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, where P14 medical had ten employees and is owned by a Tory Councillor.  Meller’s owner gave £60k to party, Shetland has given £400k for special access to PM etc. as part of the ‘Leader’s Group’. \nAlso, the National Audit Office has carried out a review in terms of regarding the contracting of PPE during the crisis, which was apparently agreed without going through the official process. \nDuring the pandemic, AHRC-funded research has studied questions relating to legal and ethical perspectives and responsiveness within health and social care in the government.  These studies have related to COVID--19 related fraud, public sector procurement and use of management of data by the public sector such as through vaccine development, uptake and delivery.   The University of Bristol have completed a specific study focusing on fraud during the pandemic and whether the rules for criminalizing fraud is fit for purpose.  The research highlighted the need for reform of current practices and that prosecutorial guidance needed to be produced to minimize the role of conspiracy to defraud.  Overall, there needs to be greater transparency in terms of data relating to conspiracy to defraud with suggestions that publication of disaggregated charging figures be used. \nThere are a lot of lessons to be learned from the pandemic in terms of tightening up the governance in organisations to improve processes and business continuity plans through supply chains and sourcing strategies which are redesigned to focus on resilience rather than focusing on lowest price. \nIs this just an amplification of the existing cosy relationship between governments of whatever party, and corporates?\n\nTopic

due to contracts to ensure no evictions resulting in a gap between wealthier professionals and those who have to work face to face.    Following COVID-19 and the removal of all restrictions some employers are forcing their workers back to the office which is resulting in the great resignation which reflects how employees are reviewing their work life balance and looking for employees that can offer fully home working or hybrid working.  This is a good article to read which relates to CSR and COVID-19:  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joms.12642Links to an external site..\nFollowing COVID, it has been identified that organisations need to be able to react more rapidly and be more agile and responsive to the needs of policy makers and citizens.   One of the most urgent needs is to build a persuasive knowledge society which is informed by integrated and trustworthy science to develop the knowledge to respond to today’s challenges.  However access to knowledge creation and dissemination needs to be equitable to leading to the three pillars of sustainable development reviewed in an earlier week.  The world we live in needs to be more interconnected and there needs to be solutions designed through open and inclusive sciences through the support of all governments.  International collaboration, engaging with knowledge partners and fostering networks of mutual learning can help problem solve across the world.\nThere is suggestion of a need for more public and private partnerships to engage in the sustainability agenda to enable this rapid response and throughout COVID-19 the private sector contributed most to research activities and were able to share data or make their technology platforms available for track and trace for example.\nOne of the key trends following COVID-19 is how organisations adapt to the new world through for example home/hybrid working.  Some organisations have closed their large offices in large cities in the UK and have moved to fully remove working or a hybrid model with hot desking and employees coming into smaller shared spaces at least once a week.  Flexible working and home working has intensified throughout the pandemic, and it now remains should be return to onsite work?  With organisations that have 100% productivity what is the need to go back to their offices and how will this make it better?  Some employees have refused to return to the workplace, and this is something organisations need to consider.  Organisations need to consider a portfolio-based approach to work in terms of using multiple options such as automation, gig talent, alliances and through outsourcing activities.  Organisations will need to restructure, and they will need to ensure that their employees have the right skills to defuse risk, optimise costs and develop needed capabilities.  Companies that will thrive post COVID will be those that have the right mix of flexibility and resilience.\nMatt Symonds, one of the Co-founders of Fortuna Admissions has suggested there are seven ways to make business truly sustainable post COVID.\nSeven Ways to Make Business Truly Sustainable Post-COVID (forbes.com)Links to an external site.\nThese are:\nFlattening the curve – in terms of for example, demand for health care systems or through the demand for utilities through managing interrelated systems and AI to help individuals respond to market conditions\nEngage with the local community at a grass roots level – going beyond emissions for example and really working with diverse communities through organisations seeing local community as their partners in achieving human security, sustainability and resilience.\nRealise the global impact of your actions – rethink production, trade and consumption models in sufficiency instead of continued growth\nEmpower employees to make them happier and more productive – changes to management thinking and trust to make people happy and productive through remove working by empowering employees. Organisations need to develop trusting relationships characterised by supportive leadership, mutual support and shared commitment.\nDon’t “go it alone” to solve difficult problems – the pandemic has shown that organisations need to pool together their resources to find ways to tackle major challenges and therefore collaboration bring together inter-disciplinary experts who have insight to identify solutions. Having inclusive and productive culture which is underpinned by revised reward systems and promotion partners leads to embedded partnerships.\nDon’t make profit your sole priority – organisations should act responsibly by paying their taxes as opposed to trying to avoid these (as seen in earlier lessons. Organisations that have a “just in time” operational practices and associate this with their financial strategies links to the profit maximizing thing to do. \nEmbrace “green capitalism” – should we revisit the model of capitalism as COVID has shown how shareholder capitalism in the form of cooperative with stakeholders and shareholders is good business.\nHow effective do you think these practices will be post COVID and are there any other practices that you think organisations should consider in the future?\nPost COVID Supply Chain Sustainability Trends\nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis we have seen vulnerabilities to the supply chain and therefore transformational change needs to take place so that in future supply chains are not as significantly affected and trade can still happen.\nOne of the ways this can happen is through increased supply chain transparency.  Due to lockdowns and reduced working, global supply chains were damaged throughout COVID-19 and organisations need to review the resilience of these in future to increase business sustainability.  One of the ways this can happen is through increased technology and digital maps (or digital twins) of their supply chains.  Digital maps contain all the relevant information on an organisation’s suppliers, their sites, any products at risk and enables them to conduct scenario analysis to inform contingency plans.   These maps will help organisations make vital decisions without having to scramble for unorganised data or rely on one or two suppliers during times of change. \nThe Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures provides recommendations on how organisations can assess their own risks and present opportunities for improvements through climate change through innovation of new products and services to create wider range of procurement channels that mitigate risk and drive supplier competition.\nOne of the key trends following COVID is the importance of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in terms of people from vulnerable communities and how they are being exploited through environmental practices.  Organisations need to review their supply chains to make sure they are inclusive and sustainable to move society forwards.\nOrganisations need to consider the reduction with suppliers they have direct as well as indirect contact with.  Most organisations deal with suppliers who then deal with other suppliers in the chain.  The organisation may use the supplier for their ethical and sustainable practices, but how does it view the practices of those two or three layers into the supply chain that they have no direct contact with?  This is interesting and something organisations need to consider in the future.  They may have no contractual relationship with these lower suppliers, but their ethical practices may impact and influence their ethical and sustainability polices. \nOrganisations need to revisit the social agenda and the disadvantaged and marginalised across the communities and what they need to do to drive diversity, inclusion and fairer human rights through meeting the needs of various stakeholders.  Technology is advancing at such a range that it is increasing the privacy and human rights agenda as we have seen in previous weeks of this unit.  There is growing importance for organisation to align new technologies with human right principles.  Organisations need to consider their “executive compensation” packages for retiring or removal of executives.  The community are conscious of these unfair practices and it is clear that large payoffs for corrupt senior executives is no longer ethical or good sustainable business practice.\nHealth and wellbeing are growing areas for organisations through the pandemic but also for organisations to focus more on the long-term physical goals of their employees.  Organisations are investing in programmes such as meditation, yoga and relaxation classes or supporting employees through paid gym membership fees as they have identified that investing in the long-term health of their employees provides benefits to the organisation through better customer services and employee engagement and productivity.\n\nTopic 10\nPrevious\nNext\n10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 10 – Business Ethics in the Pandemic > 10.4 Activity 1 – COVID-19 impacts\n\nDiscussion Activity -

Environment/Sustainability\nPositive Effects: During lockdowns, air and water pollution levels dropped due to reduced travel and industrial activity. For example, cities experienced clearer skies and cleaner rivers.\nNegative Effects: These improvements were temporary. As activities resumed, pollution levels rebounded. Additionally, the pandemic led to a surge in medical waste, like disposable masks and gloves, which increased environmental pollution.\nConclusion: The pandemic showed that environmental improvements are possible but require sustained efforts beyond temporary shutdowns.\n2. Globalisation\nDisruptions: COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages of goods and highlighting the risks of over-reliance on international trade.\nShifts: Some countries began focusing more on local production and reducing dependence on global suppliers.\nConclusion: While globalisation faced challenges, it adapted rather than reversed. The pandemic emphasized the need for more resilient and diversified supply chains.\n3. Stakeholders\nCommunication Changes: With restrictions on gatherings, businesses and organizations shifted to online platforms to engage with stakeholders.\nChallenges: Virtual interactions couldn't fully replace the benefits of in-person meetings, leading to difficulties in building trust and collaboration.\nConclusion: The pandemic accelerated digital engagement but also highlighted the importance of personal connections in stakeholder relationships.\n4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nIncreased Focus: Companies placed greater emphasis on CSR, supporting communities through donations, adapting operations to produce essential goods, and ensuring employee well-being.\nStrategic Integration: CSR became more integrated into core business strategies, reflecting a shift towards long-term sustainability and social responsibility.\nConclusion: The pandemic reinforced the importance of CSR, showing that ethical practices can align with business success.\n5. Third Sector (Charities and Nonprofits)\nAdaptation: Many organizations quickly adapted by moving services online and finding new ways to support communities.\nFinancial Strain: Despite increased demand for services, many faced funding challenges due to economic downturns.\nConclusion: The third sector demonstrated resilience and innovation but requires ongoing support to sustain its vital role in society.\nOverall Reflection: The impacts of COVID-19 confirm many theoretical approaches discussed in the module. They highlight the interconnectedness of global systems, the importance of sustainable practices, and the need for ethical responsibility across all sectors. These insights will be valuable for the upcoming assignment.\nExpand discussion thread from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hazza Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nOhoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n29 May 6:29| Last edited 29 May 6:30| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nReply from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\nEnvironment:\nCOVID caused a short drop in emissions.\nIt showed the need for greener, long-term practices.\nImpact: Boost in eco-friendly tech and digital supply chains.\nExample: DHL used digital mapping to cut emissions and improve delivery efficiency.\nGlobalisation:\nThe pandemic disrupted global supply chains.\nCompanies are now going more local and flexible.\nImpact: Less reliance on overseas suppliers.\nExample: UK supermarkets sourced more local produce due to import delays.\nStakeholders:\nMany workers faced health risks and poor treatment.\nTrust in employers dropped during the crisis.\nImpact: More focus on employee safety and rights.\nExample: Amazon workers protested over unsafe working conditions.\nCSR:\nSome companies helped, others acted selfishly.\nCSR was tested during the pandemic.\nImpact: Increased pressure for genuine, people-first actions.\nExample: Pret offered NHS workers free drinks and discounts.\nThird Sector:\nCharities faced more demand but limited funding.\nShort-term support wasn’t enough.\nImpact: Need for long-term partnerships and stability.\nExample: UK food banks saw usage soar while struggling to meet needs.\nConclusion:\nCOVID revealed ethical and operational weaknesses.\nIt confirmed the need for responsible, fair business.\nImpact: Push for sustainability, fairness, and stakeholder trust.\nExample: Many businesses now include well-being in their long-term goals.\nExpand discussion thread from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf Almheiri\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Ohoud Mohamed Salim Aljallaf AlmheiriReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAbdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n23 May 12:19| Last reply 30 May 8:59\nManage Discussion by Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\nReply from Abdulla Hasan Mohamed Ibrahim Alhammadi\n \nEnvironment & Sustainability\nImpact:\nTemporary environmental improvements during lockdowns (e.g. reduced air pollution).\nRise in plastic and medical waste post-pandemic.\nTheory: Confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve – economic shifts affect environmental outcomes.\nExample: Global drop in emissions during 2020, followed by rebound due to recovery activities\n Globalisation\nImpact:\nDisrupted global supply chains led to regionalisation.\nEmphasis on supply chain resilience and local sourcing.\nTheory: Supports “glocalization” – global framework with local execution.\nExample: Firms reshoring manufacturing to reduce dependency\nStakeholders\nImpact:\nShift to digital stakeholder engagement; highlighted the digital divide.\nTheory: Partially challenges Stakeholder Theory – virtual tools aren’t always inclusive.\nExample: Limited access in remote areas affected community involvement\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nImpact:\nCompanies with strong CSR showed higher resilience.\nCSR efforts expanded to include public health and community aid.\nTheory: Supports Business Case for CSR – social responsibility strengthens long-term success.\nExample: CSR-linked firms had better stock performance.\nReference: ScienceDirect (2024)\n\nThird Sector (NGOs/Nonprofits)\nImpact:\nFaced funding cuts, but adapted with innovation and digital solutions.\nTheory: Confirms Resource Dependence Theory – success depends on adaptability.\nExample: Virtual fundraising and partnerships increased\n \nReferences ;\nScienceDirect (2024).

I examined the correlation between each point and theoretical frameworks, as well as whether actual occurrences corroborate or contest such concepts.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nLockdowns resulted in diminished pollutant levels owing to decreased transportation and industrial operations. Conversely, plastic waste has grown due to masks, takeout packaging, and medical supplies. Additionally, several enterprises postponed their sustainability objectives owing to fiscal pressures.\nExample: In 2020, cities like as London had improved air quality during lockdowns, although encountered increased waste from personal protective equipment (PPE).\nTheory: This somewhat undermines sustainability theory, which anticipates long-term advancement. The COVID-19 pandemic shown that advancements might be impeded during crises.\nGlobalisation\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the interconnectedness of the global community. When one nation ceased operations, others were impacted as well. Supply networks were disrupted, trade diminished, and travel ceased. Numerous enterprises began seeking local suppliers to mitigate potential hazards.\nExample: UK supermarkets saw shortages due to the inability of international suppliers to deliver.\nTheory: This validates globalization theory, demonstrating that international commerce amplifies risks during global crises.\nStakeholders\nThe outbreak affected employees, consumers, vendors, and local communities. Some corporations stressed employee wellness, while others focused only on simple survival. Employee welfare and job security surfaced as prominent issues.\nExample: Companies like Morrisons offered monetary incentives to employees, whilst others enacted layoffs.\nTheory: This validates stakeholder theory, which posits that corporations must consider all stakeholders, not alone profit.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nMany companies escalated their initiatives during the crisis. They allocated funds, aided critical personnel, or endorsed the NHS. Some employed their resources to aid the public instead of only selling products.\nExample: McDonald’s provided complimentary lunches to NHS personnel, while BrewDog manufactured hand sanitizers.\nTheory: This substantiates CSR theory, demonstrating that ethical behavior is crucial, particularly during a crisis.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-Profits)\nCharities had considerable difficulties during the COVID-19 epidemic. Events were canceled and contributions decreased. Concurrently, a growing population requires support with nutrition, shelter, and mental health.\nExample: The Trussell Trust, a food bank organization, experienced a significant increase in individuals need food assistance.\nTheory: This undermines the notion that the third sector can consistently bridge the gap; they require additional support and investment during crises.\nFinal Notes for Assignment: COVID-19 confirmed many theories about business responsibility and ethics, but it also showed weaknesses, especially in sustainability and the third sector. These notes will help me explain how theory meets real life in my assignment.\n \n \nExpand discussion thread from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Hatem Zain Alla Mabrouk Abdulla AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAmer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n19 May 13:10| Last reply 23 May 9:26\nManage Discussion by Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nReply from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Business and Society\nI learned a lot from the courses and my own study. I realized that COVID-19 had a huge influence on many parts of business and society. Here are the effects I've found, along with real-life examples and how they fit with theory.\nEnvironment / Sustainability\nThe situation got better in certain aspects at the start of COVID-19. There were fewer automobiles and flights, which meant less pollution in the air. But as time went on, more trash was made, mostly from masks, gloves, and take-out boxes. A lot of businesses also put their aspirations to go green on hold so they could focus on staying alive.\nThis goes against sustainability philosophy since it indicates that when circumstances are tough, environmental ideals aren't always the most important thing.\nGlobalisation\nThe epidemic made it very hard for trade to happen over the world. Because to manufacturing and border closures, a lot of firms couldn't receive the goods they needed. Ford and Toyota, for example, had to cease making cars because they didn't have enough parts. To reduce future danger, several businesses are increasingly choosing local suppliers.\nThis backs up the thesis of globalization by showing how interrelated countries are and how a problem in one location may affect the whole world.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 had an effect on workers, consumers, suppliers, and communities. A lot of people lost their employment or had to work from home. Health and safety were more essential. Some companies did a good job of taking care of their employees (such Tesco awarding bonuses), while others were criticized for not doing enough.\nThis backs up stakeholder theory, which claims that businesses should care for all of their stakeholders, not just their shareholders.\nCSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)\nA lot of businesses started doing more to aid the neighborhood. BrewDog, for instance, provided hand sanitizer, and grocery stores opened early for NHS personnel and seniors. During the crisis, some businesses really cared.\nThis backs up CSR theory by showing that companies can be responsible, even when things are rough.\nThird Sector (Charities and Non-profits)\nDuring the epidemic, it was challenging for charities. There were fewer donations and events were canceled. But people wanted their aid more. Food banks like The Trussell Trust, for instance, witnessed a huge rise in the number of individuals who needed help.\nThis goes against some ideas in the third sector since it revealed how hard it is for charities to get by when they don't have enough money.\nConclusion\nThe pandemic showed that business is not just about profit. It confirmed that companies have responsibilities to the environment, people, and society. At the same time, it also showed that in a crisis, some of these responsibilities can be pushed aside. These insights help me better understand how theory applies to real-world situations.\nExpand discussion thread from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam Albreiki\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\n1 Reply, 1 Unread\nReply to post from Amer Omar Abdulla Akzam AlbreikiReply\nMark as readMark as read\n\nMark post as read\nAlyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\n19 May 0:35| Last reply 19 May 8:41\nManage Discussion by Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nReply from Alyazia Ayed Husain Mohammed Al Ahbabi\nAlyazia Ayed Al Ahbabi\nID: 2447614\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Key Areas\n1.

However, these gains were temporary; Less than two years after the pandemic began, emissions had returned to the levels seen before the outbreak, solidifying Blowfield’s (2013) view that many programs for environmental sustainability address surface-level issues without fundamentally transforming systems. The pandemic also paused corporate climate action, exposing a tension between environmental ambition and short-term financial survival. This challenges the optimistic premise in Carroll's Corporate Social Performance model that sustainability is always included in strategic planning. As argued by Blowfield, it confirms the requirement for transformational, as opposed to incremental change.\nGlobalization\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed how vulnerable the world’s supply networks have become, causing major shortages of essential goods. Griffin argued that rising levels of globalization significantly enhance systemic risk, which came to light during the pandemic. Many major companies reassessed the way they source and manufacture goods, prioritizing local and regional production. This question, the ‘globalization at all costs’ perspective emphasized in earlier CSR and stakeholder theories, encourages a risk-sensitive and resilient approach to globalization. Carroll's view that business corporations operate in a tightly linked global stakeholder ecosystem continues to hold, but COVID-19 illustrates that excessive reliance on global interdependence undermines resilience.\nStakeholders\nCOVID-19 has rewritten stakeholder priorities. Employees' health and well-being were on the radar, highlighting companies' social responsibility beyond profit margins. Amazon was beset by global protests against unsafe working conditions at warehouses, while Microsoft and Salesforce enhanced remote work benefits and mental health support. This confirms the relevance of Stakeholder Theory (Freeman, as cited in Carroll, 2023) that asserts businesses must consider a wide array of stakeholder interests. But it also challenges companies that only gave lip service to stakeholder care before the pandemic. Griffin (2014) states that crises test reputation credibility; in the case of COVID-19, companies that addressed issues honestly with stakeholders kept trust, but others lost their reputations.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nThe pandemic then proved to be a litmus test for genuine CSR. A few organizations shifted gear to purpose-driven action, Unilever handed out complimentary hygiene items, while LVMH converted perfume factories into hand sanitizer production. Such action underlines Carroll's (2023) CSR Pyramid, demonstrating that companies are able to uphold ethical and philanthropic responsibilities even amidst crisis. Yet, other firms reduced CSR spending or applied CSR as publicity, validating Crane's (2016) fear that CSR is symbolic instead of strategic. COVID-19 thus both proved and experimented with theoretical foundations, depending on whether CSR was deeply ingrained or more performative.\nThird Sector\nThe third sector experienced both pressure and visibility. Charity and NGO demand, especially for vaccination outreach, mental health, and food banks, soared. However, funding decreased as governments and donors reallocated resources. This confirms Carroll's and Crane's contention that the third sector is a necessary partner in system-level crises. It also confirms Blowfield's contention that cross-sector working is the solution to sustainable change. However, the pandemic also revealed the weakness of those third-sector organizations that lacked any digital infrastructure or scalable support systems, highlighting a need for capacity-building.\nConclusion\nOverall, COVID-19 strengthened and challenged the strengths and vulnerabilities of current sustainability, CSR, and stakeholder theory. It strengthened such theories as frameworks that are based on ethical leadership, stakeholder interaction, and systemic resilience, but challenged models that were too globalized or superficial. Next-generation business models will be required to evolve accordingly, both theoretically and practically.\n \nSources\nBlowfield, M. (2013). Business and sustainability.

You can read more at:  Responsible Business in a post COVID-19 world | Deloitte SwitzerlandLinks to an external site.\nOne way to do this is through ethical supply chains such as ensuring eradication of child labour, ensuring safe and hygienic working conditions, ensuring employees are paid fairly for the hours worked, ensuring humane and non-discriminatory treatment, demonstrating environmental awareness and removing anti-bribery.\nTesco is an example of an organisation who use multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing.  For example they have an Action, Collaboration and Transformation group that ensures that those that make their garments achieve the living wage through collective bargaining and freedom of association.  They also engage with the Better Cotton Initiative which looks to improve cotton farming practices to bring economic, social and environmental benefits.  Tesco engage in over 30 different initiatives and you can read more about these here:  https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/documents/policies/tesco-and-multi-stakeholder-initiatives-for-responsible-sourcing/Links to an external site.\nConsidering these different factors, who is accountable for responsible business practices?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.2 Responsible Leadership\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.2 Responsible Leadership\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way organisations are lead and in 2020 business leaders had to respond to the crisis at pace with no previous experience to draw on.  They had to balance the safety of their front-line workers with need to enable staff to work from home.  Technology has enabled leaders to be more visible in organisations with some holding weekly company updates which would not have happened pre-COVID.  Also leaders are exposed to some of the social problems such as Black Lives Matter and have to consider how these impact their workforces.  Leaders have had to become more considerate to a wider range of stakeholder needs during the COVID years and have had to make value based and purpose drive decisions during this difficult time.  Leaders have had to create sustained social impact due to mental health and wellbeing responses to the pandemic with some employees refusing to attend the workplace.  They have had to demonstrate caring relationships with customers, employees, families and colleagues along with shareholders and front-line workers. \nAs outlined by CIPD in 2022, responsible leadership has three different levels which became apparent during the pandemic:\nIndividual: the personal integrity of leaders was a critical factor during COVID-19, with leaders under intense pressure. Many talked about needing to fall back onto their personal sense of right and wrong. They spoke of a new-found humility, born out of having to learn to listen to others. \nOrganisational: in terms of role-modelling a response, many felt liberated. People also spoke of ‘taking off their armour’, implying that pre-COVID-19, they were operating in an organisational system that stifled their personal sense of right and wrong. \nSocietal: leaders were heavily engaged with health services and government, trying to ascertain what their organisations could do to help society. Communicating far more with the outside world, albeit virtually, they were in the company of like-minded leaders, sharing a common purpose.  (CIPD, 2022)\nThe pandemic has changed the way we live and work and there is impatience about the pace of change particularly when change was very fast during the pandemic.  Society wants greater justice and fairness through pay rewards and we are seeing various organisations in 2022 starting to strike over pay and conditions.  Organisations are becoming flatter with empathy and accessibility to senior teams which was not seen pre-COVID.  Rana Foroohar reported that if the rich don’t give a bit more today, they may have to give a lot more tomorrow.’ (2022) Financial Times.\nWatch this YouTube video which redefines responsible leadership from Accenture World: 5 Elements of Responsible Leadership | AccentureLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about their comments in terms of responsible leadership?\n\nTopic 11\nPrevious\nNext\n11.3 What now?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 11 – The Future of Business Post Pandemic > 11.3 What now?\n\nThroughout the lessons you have seen poor practices where COVID loans have been abused by fraudsters and how senior politicians helped their friends with business contacts.  Test and trace used huge amounts of money with the better off being able to avoid financial costs of self-isolation through being able to work at home.  Wage inequality is rising in the UK and fewer are working because of long-COVID and delays to NHS treatment. \nThe ex-conservative government have been accused of “partygate” through not following COVID-19 regulations against individuals who have faced severe suffering through eg loss of loved ones and not being able to attend funerals.  This has resulted in the UK population becoming disillusioned with government and the resignation of Boris Johnson.\nCOVID has changed our lives and people are eager to travel for leisure but hybrid working has had significant impact on public transport and the city economics as people are not travelling to work.   Even though employers are making staff attend the workplace, remote working is here to stay with 25% of all professional jobs in North America being removed by the end of 2022 and this is set to increase.  This home working environment provides many benefits in terms of physical and mental well-being and large companies such as Goldman Sachs have retreated and offering working from home policies.  However we are living through transformation with automation and AI which is changing the skills that organisations are looking for.\n\nDeliotte in their “Workforce of the Future 2030” report have suggested there will be four worlds of work:\nRed – incubator for innovation racing to give consumers what they want, using digital platforms to enable those with winning ideas to be successful, where ideas rule innovation and outpaces regulation with high risks\nBlue – the corporate is king where bigger is better and where organisation size and influence is the best way to protect their profit margins against intense competition and they grow at such a scale and exert influence to become more powerful and larger than national economies\nGreen – corporate social responsibility is business imperative and organisations are characterised by social conscience, sense of environmental responsibility and they focus on diversity, human rights and trust is the basic currency underpinning business and employment\nYellow – humans come first with social-first and community businesses finding the greatest success to prosper.

transformation and defining their own ambition level for each of the action fields in their sustainability strategy.  They will need to consider whether they will focus on a certain area or wider range of sustainability measures to remain competitive.   Organisations that fail to make these changes and address sustainability are likely to pose risks to their own business in terms of reputational damage, environmental risks and supply chain risks.  Organisations must make sustainability their guiding principles to boost energy efficiency through increased levels of recycling or rethinking their business model to discover new market potential. \nThe UK government has a 25 year sustainability plan which mainly focuses on environmental effects such as lowering carbon footprint, minimising waste and enhancing biodiversity on their sites.  The government also aims to enhance local communities and business to better contribute to quality of life for future generations.   Some of the work is based in previous mining areas of the UK which have suffered significant disadvantage through the loss of mining as income but also damage to the environment in these areas.  \n (Sustainability plan - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)Links to an external site..\nThe UK government have set targets to ensure better jobs and earning potential across all supply chains, developing

responsibility and changing world of work.  Due to COVID 19 the speed of change across the world has intensified and organisations need to consider and develop these practices to be really sustainable and responsible businesses of the future.  They also need to consider problems the world is facing in relation to climate change, poverty, rising cost of living related to energy costs, online GP appointments and hospital visits and self-driving cars.  Producing foods including meets which are less harmful to the environment will be a key challenge for agriculture and overall a key investment

of right and wrong and we will consider this firstly from a moral, rather than a business perspective.  Ethical theory underpins the study of business ethics, and it is important that you have a grasp of this as you work through this module as you will need to demonstrate your understanding throughout the assessment.   Therefore the theory of ethics attempts to provide a clear, unified account of our own ethical obligations.  There are three main theories of ethics which you will review during this week – utilitarian, deontological and virtue ethics. \nHowever there are also Normative ethical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong from a given situation (Crane and Matten, 2016).  We will look at these in the next section.  They are important to the ways that businesses make decisions that can be defended, justified and explained to relevant stakeholders.  These theories will differ in terms of how you determine the moral worth of an action, and we will explore this during this week.  So where do ethics and theory of ethics come from?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\nv2.2 Where has ethics come from?\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.2 Where has ethics come from?\n\nEthics is underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics and we will review each of these in this section.  There is a long history of ethical theory and the decision of right and wrong has been of utmost importance since life began and, in some cases, it is a matter of life and death for people across the world.\n\nFigure 1:  Image showing ethics underpinned by religion, philosophy and politics\nOver time the arenas for these ethical discussions have developed into organised religion, schools of philosophy, and political movements and parties.  The ethical discussions we have today, including those in a business context are, therefore, shaped by our own historical, religious, and cultural backgrounds, which can of course be very different depending on where we’re from.  And these categories have always and still do overlap.\n\nReligion\nRules and principles of religion advise us that there should be no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct or intoxicants through the religious teachings.  Religion and faith are a set of rules of how to act ethically and spiritually and there are consequences for the actions in terms of salvation, enlightenment, reincarnation or damnation. \nTherefore religion teaches us to:\ndemonstrate honesty and fidelity to family and those we know\nbe non-violent, demonstrate self-restraint, non-stealing, purity, truth\nconsider how every breach of promise in commerce is a sin\nlove one’s enemies, turn the other cheek\nhow morality for you and for others, including business behaviour\nLet’s look at religion and the six here are divided into three from the far east and south asia, and three what are called Abrahamic religions.\nBuddhism is concerned with the good life as we live it\nConfucianism the duty is more about people we know closely, more than the general responsibility to all others\nHinduism tenets are more universal, we should be like this with everyone\nJudaism is specific about business – more on this than on food/kosher etc in the holy texts.\nChristianity similar to Judaism but also talks of 7 sins and 7 virtues\nIslam forbids the charging of interest\nInfluence of religion endures today, however there are differences between Catholic/Lutheran and Calvinist traditions in Europe and the USA and there are specific injunctions around abstaining from economic life (holy days) or the practice of charging interest.  Interfaith declaration (1994) set key principles of justice; mutual respect; stewardship; honesty and recently religious figures have been commenting on business practice, investing or divesting wealth in various industries.   An example of this is where the Church of England tried to rescue Wonga (the loans company) and convert it to a non-profit organisation. It was asked to stop investing in Amazon, but hasn’t, despite saying it was a bad company.  The Church of England is an investor not just a faith and they have an investment fund valued at £9.2 billion which has been criticised for where it invests this funding, and this fund has received a return of 8.5% per year.  It plans to divest from fossil fuel companies by 2033, although some leading figures in the Church of England and its investment board have a background in companies like BP and Esso and therefore whether this will happen or not is open to discussion.\nThinking about Christianity and Easter and Christmas and business closure at these times of the year.  How do organisations overcome the differences when some of the employees do not celebrate these events and therefore eg have to have different practices in place for other religions?\nIn the UK there are still examples of traditional Christian practices such as lack of Sunday opening across some businesses and being the day when families attended church. \nWhat other practices can you think of that have a religious focus?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.3 Ethical Theories – Normative and Descriptive\n\nEthical theories are the rules and principles that determine right and wrong for any given situation, for example:\nNormative ethical theories are those that propose to prescribe the morally correct way of acting\nDescriptive ethical theories seek to describe how ethics decisions are actually made in business\nWhen it comes to the role of ethical theory, there are two extreme positions\nEthical absolutism asserts eternal, universally applicable moral principles:\nRight and wrong are objective qualities, can be rationally determined\nEthical relativism claims morality is context-dependent and subjective:\nNo universal rights & wrongs that can be rationally determined, all depends on person making the decision, culture in which they operate\nThe following image shows a typology of ethical theories and how they are divided into conduct and character and then the different theories such as egoism, utilitarianism, Kantianism, Aristotelianism.\nCan you think of an example of poor ethical conduct at work?\nCan you think of poor ethical characters at work? \n2.4 Unilitariansim\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.4 Unilitariansim\n\nAccording to utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it results in the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people affected by the action, and also names as the “greatest happiness principle” which is based on a similar approach to cost-benefit analysis.  Jeremy Bentham contributed to this theory, and he suggested that “humans are motivated by avoidance of pain and gain of pleasure” resulting in “consequentialist” theory of ethics.  “Consequentialism” means the moral quality of an action is determined by its consequences eg right or wrong will depend on the consequences of an act eg lying is wrong but if it saved it a life then it would be right (moral quality of the action). \n\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.5 Ethics of Duty (Kant)\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724-1804) derived ethics of duty and argued that morality and decisions about right and wrong are not dependent on situation or actions.   He suggested that morality was defined by a set of moral rules that humans should apply to all relevant ethical problems (Crane and Matten, 2016).   He suggested three principles that constitute a “test” of whether a particular action should be ethical.\nPrinciple 1: Consistency - Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\nPrinciple 2: Human Dignity - Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only.\nPrinciple 3: Universality - Act only so that actions are “universally lawgiving” i.e. that rules guiding our actions are acceptable to every rational human being, not because they have been told to accept them i.e. would others agree with you?\n \nConsider the following transplant dilemma:\nA brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveller, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine check-up. In the course of doing the check-up, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor.\nDo you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.6 Virtue Ethics\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.6 Virtue Ethics\n\nVirtue ethics uses character and integrity-based approaches to business ethics with the message “good actions come from good persons” (Crane and Matten, 2016).   These contend that morally correct actions are those undertaken by actors with virtuous characters. Therefore, the formation of a virtuous character is the first step towards morally correct behaviour and not just a one-off decision Some of the acquired traits are:\nIntellectual virtues – “wisdom”\nMoral virtues – “honesty”, “courage,” “friendship”, “mercy”, “loyalty”, “modesty”, “patience” etc.\nEthics of virtue are central to the notion of “good life” and Aristotle argued that when we do something we do it to gain an end and that the ultimate end of all ends was the chief good, the greatest good.  Aristotle suggested that the best businessman is the one who practices virtue, not the one who makes the most money and this is because s/he can be satisfied with that goodness.   Therefore, if it’s good for you it will be good for all and thinking it’s good for all will help you be good.\n\nTopic 2\n2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.7 Ethics of rights and justice\n\nEthics can be defined by natural rights or alternative frameworks that focus on relationships such as eg feminist ethics.  Natural rights are based on basic, important, unalienable entitlements that should be respected and protected in every single action, such as:\nbased on consensus about nature of human dignity\nstrongly based in western view of morality\nWhereas justice is the simultaneously fair treatment of individuals in a given situation with the result that everybody gets what they deserve such as:\nFair procedures (procedural justice)\nFair outcomes (distributive justice)\nThere are strong in the western tradition and flows from politics.  However should we all receive equal benefit?  Or should we strive for equal access to opportunity?\nThere are some limits of traditional theories in that they are:\nToo abstract\nToo reductionist\nToo objective and elitist\nToo impersonal\nToo rational and codified\nToo imperialist\nDo you think we look to alternative approaches?\n\nPlease use the accordions to reveal more information\nFeminist ethics\nDiscourse ethics\n\n\n\nPluralist approach\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.8 Ethical Decision making\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.8 Ethical Decision making\n\nEthical decision making is the process you would follow to ensure that decisions are based on ethical values.  For example, thinking of COVID-19 and health care professionals, many ethical dilemmas were presented in terms of making life and death decisions whilst allocating scarce resources eg such as the ventilators.  Ethical decision-making focuses on clarifying thinking about the issues, assist in the analysis of the issues involved and providing a rational way to defend a particular course of action.    Decisions have to be made on the best available information and information and personal choices must be respected.  These are generally concerned with decision making and particularly in making models of how this occurs, and ethical theories, principles and values can help but won’t solve the dilemma on their own. \nSo what is an ethical decision?  It is one that:\nIs likely to have significant effects on others\nIs likely to present with a number of choices\nOne or more party perceives this as an ethical question – even if you do not! If you use someone’s Netflix login you probably don’t care. Do they?\nThe diagram below provides a framework for understanding ethical decision making:\nFramework for understanding ethical decision-making\n2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.9 Rights and Duties in the Workplace\n\nRights and duties are really important in the workplace and Crane and Matten (2019, pg. 292) have produced a list resulting in a code of contract for ethical employment and it covers some of the “grey areas” which are not always covered by employment laws and regulations.\n \nFigure 4L  Rights and duties of employees (Crane and Matten, 2019, p.292)\nThe rights and duties of employees sets out the relationship between them and it offers the employees benefits in exchange for performance and for adhering to the rules.    Organisations need to provide training and outline the values of business ethics to employees in order to improve ethical decision-making in the workplace.  Senior leaders need to be the role models and demonstrate ethical behaviours and they need to be accountable for ethical violations and ensure they keep their promises and commitments to the workplace.   However organisations need to be careful as ethical decisions could be influenced by reward eg doing the right thing is rewarded for example, financially by managers and these practices need to be embedded within the values and practices demonstrated across the organisation.   Therefore ethical behaviour should be rewarded, and unethical behaviour should be punished.  Stakeholders have power to influence leaders and they should ensure that pressure is placed on stakeholders to act both ethically and unethically.\n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\nHome > Module Overview  > Topic 2 – Theory of Ethics and Ethics at Work > 2.10 Good Work – A Historical Review\n\nThere is no longer a “job for life” and employees will experience different jobs and even careers across their working lives.   Post-Fordism is the term that is used to demonstrate how industrial production has moved away from huge production factories, pioneered by Henry Ford towards now where we have very much a knowledge economy.  In the Fordist era there were strong trade union representation and employees were given annual rises related to productivity and industrial peace (no strikes).  However we now are facing the rise of the “precariat” worker who has little or no job security (eg Uber drivers), little or no savings and many are often migrants to the UK or from BAME backgrounds.  Jobs such as Uber driving offers some semi-regular pay from very low-skilled work.  Currently young people have massive university debt that they are struggling to repay and graduates with a degree but few employment prospects.  As Uber drivers are classed as “workers” rather than “employees” they were not entitled to some basic rights such as sick leave, holiday pay and the minimum wage, however following a legal battle in 2021, Uber has now agreed to pay these to their drivers.  These drivers are typically contracted under non-standard arrangements eg on zero-hour contracts or independent contracts or through an agency.  These contracts really help employers cut costs and say in business; however it is a huge exploitation of individual employment rights. \n\nSome Business Examples of ethical practices during the Pandemic\nDuring the pandemic Cineworld closed down and staff found out through twitter and news reports rather than directly from management within the organisation.\nSecondly, Boohoo were part of the Levitt enquiry which focussed on duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain.\nThe enquiry found:\nBoohoo’s extraordinary commercial growth has been so fast that its governance processes have failed to keep pace.\nIt has concentrated on revenue generation sometimes at the expense of the other, equally important, obligations which large corporate entities have.\nIt has not felt responsible for conditions in the Leicester factories on anything other than a superficial level; and\nOn occasions it has failed to appreciate that with the enormous advantages of being a publicly listed company come responsibilities, one of which is on all occasions to act in the best interests of all the shareholders\nA conclusion was reached that the true reason that Boohoo did not become more involved in monitoring conditions in Leicester was that it saw it as being a lower priority than matters which directly affected the company (such as commercial issues or their own employees). The Leicester workers were not employed by them and so they were not their responsibility in the way that their own workforce is. To some extent this is understandable, but can lead to serious issues of the kind which Boohoo is now facing\nSports Direct and Amazon are also facing similar criticisms and you should read the case studies about some of their poor practices in the workplace:\nAmazon - Amazon raises wages amid criticism - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nSports Direct - Sports Direct staff 'not treated as humans', says MPs' report - BBC NewsLinks to an external site.\nWhat do you think about these organisations?  Would it entice you to go and work for them?\n\nDiversity and Inclusion at Work\nDiversity and inclusion have become important practices within the workplace and research suggests that a more diverse workforce is good for business such as that:\nIt can lead to more creative problem solving, innovation, and being more responsive to change.\nGives a better knowledge of diverse markets / clients.\nOrganisation has a wider talent pool to draw from.\nIt can be a PR boost from being seen to manage diversity well.\nIt can lead to higher profits -10% increase in women in organisation linked to 3% in increase in profits\nMany organisations still have a white male orientated senior leadership team in the UK and although things have been changing BAME and women are still underrepresented at senior levels in organisations.   Part of this is due to women still being classified as care workers and working part-time to be carers.   The UK introduced the gender pay gap so that organisations with over 250 employees have to publish the differences in averages between men and women, however in 2021 there was still gaps in the amount men and women were paid eg in education women were paid 26% less than men.  Gary Lineker working for the BBC was the second highest paid star at the corporation and paid more than women in similar roles.  Organisations have to address these challenges through fair procedures and although discrimination is wrong, poor practices in the workplace are still being evidenced.  This is an area for conflict as employees want to be paid the fairest and highest pay whilst employers want to pay the lowest to increase their profits and there has to be balance between high pay and high profits. \n \n\nTopic 2\nPrevious\nNext\n\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nEmployee Rights\nIssues Involved\nRight to freedom from discrimination.\nEqual opportunities.\nAffirmative action.\nReverse discrimination.\nSexual and racial harassment.\nRight to privacy\nHealth and drug testing.\nWork-life balance.\nPresenteeism.\nElectronic privacy and data protection.\nRight to due process\nPromotion.\nFiring.\nDisciplinary proceedings.\nRight to participation and association.\nOrganization of workers in works councils and trade unions.\nParticipation in the company's decisions.\nRight to healthy and safe working conditions.\nWorking conditions.\nOccupational health and safety.\nRight to fair wages.\nPay.\nIndustrial action.\nNew forms of work.\nRight to freedom of conscience and speech.\nWhistleblowing.\nRight to work.\nFair treatment in the interview.\nNon-discriminatory rules for recruitment.\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nEmployee Duties\nIssues Involved\nDuty to comply with labour contract\nAcceptable level of performance.\nWork quality.\nLoyalty to the firm.\nDuty to comply with the law.\nBribery\nDuty to respect the employer's property.\nWorking time.\nUnauthorized use of company resources for private purpose:\nFraud, theft, embezzlement.\n\nSUBSECTIONS TO COVER:\n\nPurpose:\n- Requirements: Summarize findings and suggest possible future directions for firms in sustainable and responsible business.\n- Word Count: 350\n- Theories/Models: Responsible Leadership, Future of Business Post Pandemic\n- Required Readings: Deloitte (2020), Accenture World\n\nENHANCED GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
